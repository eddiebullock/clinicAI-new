 

Clinician: Thank you for coming in today. I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me about Eddie. I’ll be asking a series of questions about his development, behaviour, and any concerns you might have. This will help us understand his strengths and challenges so that we can provide the right kind of support. If at any point you need me to clarify a question, please feel free to ask. Let’s start with his early development. 

I. Early Development 

Clinician: When did you first start noticing any concerns about Eddie’s development? 

Mum: I think it was around 18 months old. He wasn’t speaking as much as other children his age, and he didn’t seem to use gestures like pointing or waving. I also noticed he didn’t respond to his name very often. It was subtle at first, and I thought maybe he was just a quiet baby. But as time went on, I started noticing how different he was compared to other children in the playgroup. At first, I wondered if maybe I was overthinking it. A lot of people reassured me that all children develop at their own pace. My mum said that my brother was a late talker, so maybe Eddie was just following that pattern. But deep down, I felt something was different. 

Then, when we were at the playground or toddler groups, I began noticing more things. Other children would point at things they found exciting or look back at their parents to see if they were watching, but Eddie never really did that. He didn’t seem to notice if I was paying attention or not. If I pointed to something, like a bird in the sky or a dog passing by, he wouldn't follow my finger or react. He just carried on with whatever he was doing. I started watching other children his age, and I saw how much they engaged with their surroundings, whereas Eddie seemed to be in his own little world. 

Clinician: Was he meeting his physical developmental milestones, such as crawling, walking, and sitting up? 

Mum: Yes, mostly. He started crawling at around 10 months, which seemed typical, and he walked around 14 months, so there wasn’t much concern there. But his babbling and speech development seemed much slower than expected. He didn’t really engage in the usual baby talk you’d expect at that age. When he did try to speak, it was often repetitive sounds rather than words, and he didn’t mimic our speech the way other children did. I remember being reassured by friends and family that “boys sometimes talk later,” but I noticed he wasn’t just late—his whole way of communicating seemed different. 

For example, when his older sister was that age, she would babble away and try to copy what we said. If we said “dog,” she would try to repeat it, even if it came out as “da.” But Eddie didn’t do that. If he made sounds, they were often the same ones over and over, and they didn’t seem connected to what was happening around him. He never really tried to copy words or sounds. Even when he did say something, it often didn’t seem like he was using it to communicate—he would repeat words he’d heard, sometimes from TV shows, but not in a way that made sense in conversation. 

Clinician: Did he show any early signs of interest in social interaction? 

Mum: Not really. He seemed happy in his own world. He didn’t look up when we called his name, and he rarely responded to people trying to engage him. If we played peekaboo, he wouldn’t react much. I remember feeling concerned that he wasn’t as interactive as the other toddlers in his playgroup. When we went to family gatherings, he would prefer to sit in a corner playing with a toy rather than interact with cousins or other children. At first, I thought he was just shy, but even when kids tried to play with him, he would ignore them or move away. 

I remember a specific incident at a friend’s birthday party when he was about two years old. There were lots of children running around playing games, and I expected Eddie to join in at some point. But instead, he sat in a corner with a toy car, spinning the wheels over and over. He didn’t seem upset or overwhelmed—he just wasn’t interested in the other children at all. Even when another child tried to take his car or get his attention, he didn’t react. It was as if they weren’t there. That was one of the moments when I really started to worry. 

Clinician: Did he have any particular reactions to sensory experiences as a baby or toddler? 

Mum: Yes, he was extremely sensitive to noise from a very young age. Everyday household sounds that most people wouldn’t even notice could make him scream or cover his ears in distress. The vacuum cleaner was one of the worst triggers—he would cry, scream, and sometimes even run out of the room if he heard it turn on. It was as if the sound physically hurt him. Similarly, sudden loud noises, like doors slamming or someone dropping a pan in the kitchen, would send him into a panic. He would flinch, cover his ears tightly, and sometimes burst into tears. It got to the point where we had to warn him before doing something loud, like using a hairdryer or blender, so he could prepare himself or leave the room. 

His sensitivity wasn’t just to noise—he also struggled a lot with certain fabrics and textures on his skin. Some clothes would make him very upset, even if they felt soft to me. If I dressed him in something with a tag or a slightly rough fabric, he would immediately start pulling at it, whining or crying, and desperately trying to get it off. Sometimes, he would scratch at his arms or neck as if the fabric was unbearably irritating. I remember one time I bought him a new sweater that I thought he would like because it was warm and cozy, but as soon as I put it on him, he started sobbing and tugging at the sleeves, saying it was “too itchy.” He refused to wear socks with seams, and we often had to cut the tags out of his clothes to make them comfortable for him. 

He also had a strong reaction to certain textures, particularly things that felt sticky or grainy. He absolutely refused to touch sand, play dough, or anything slimy. I remember taking him to the beach once, thinking he would love playing in the sand like his sister did. But as soon as he stepped onto it, he froze in place and started crying. He held his hands up in the air, visibly distressed, and refused to put them down. When a small gust of wind blew sand onto his skin, he shrieked and frantically tried to brush it off. No amount of encouragement or reassurance helped—he just couldn’t tolerate the sensation. Eventually, we had to carry him off the beach because he wouldn’t walk on it. Even at home, if he got something sticky on his hands, like yogurt or glue from a craft project, he would become extremely anxious and demand that it be washed off immediately. If he couldn’t get rid of the feeling fast enough, he would start crying and shaking his hands as if trying to fling it off. It was clear that these sensations were genuinely overwhelming for him, far beyond a simple dislike or discomfort. 

 

Clinician: What about feeding? Did Eddie have any difficulties with eating or trying new foods? 

Mum: He was always quite picky with food. Even as a baby, he would refuse certain textures, and as he got older, he would only eat very specific foods. He doesn’t like anything mixed together, so if we give him a meal where different foods touch each other, he won’t eat it. He also gets upset if a food looks slightly different from what he expects. If we buy a different brand of a food he likes, even if it tastes the same, he sometimes refuses to eat it. I used to think it was just a phase, but he hasn’t really grown out of it. 

He also prefers foods with a predictable texture—crunchy foods are usually okay, but anything mushy or mixed is a challenge. We had so many struggles trying to introduce new foods. He would look at them suspiciously, sometimes refuse to even touch them, and if we encouraged him to take a bite, he would gag or spit it out. 

Clinician: Were there any difficulties with sleeping patterns? 

Mum: Yes, he’s never been a good sleeper. From infancy, sleep was a major struggle. He would wake up multiple times during the night, sometimes crying inconsolably, other times just sitting awake in his cot, staring at the ceiling or playing with his fingers. Even as a toddler, it was rare for him to sleep through the night without at least one or two disturbances. Even now, he still has difficulty falling asleep, and he often wakes up much earlier than he should. He seems to have an internal clock that doesn’t match up with the rest of the family—he’ll wake up at 4 or 5 AM, fully alert, while the rest of us are still exhausted. 

He gets very distressed if his bedtime routine changes in any way. If we put him to bed even 15 minutes later than usual, he struggles to settle, sometimes tossing and turning for hours. If we forget to do something in his routine—like skipping a specific lullaby or turning off the hallway light in a different order—he becomes visibly anxious and has trouble relaxing. He seems to rely on the predictability of his bedtime routine to wind down. If something disrupts it, he can become restless, irritable, or even refuse to go to bed at all. 

There are nights when he wakes up in the middle of the night and just stays awake for hours. Sometimes, he lies quietly in bed, staring at his hands or rolling a small toy between his fingers. Other times, he gets up and starts pacing around his room or whispering to himself. He doesn’t always cry, but it’s clear he’s not getting the rest he needs. It’s as if his brain is still too active to switch off. 

I remember how exhausting it was in those early years. We tried everything—soothing music, bedtime stories, white noise machines, lavender sprays, different nightlights—but nothing worked consistently. Some nights, he’d fall asleep easily, but then wake up two hours later, wide awake as if it were morning. On particularly bad nights, he would be up for hours, and by the time he finally fell back asleep, it would be almost time for the rest of us to wake up. It was like his body clock was completely out of sync, and no matter what we tried, he just couldn’t settle into a typical sleep pattern. 

We also noticed that he has an unusual sensitivity to how his sleep environment feels. If his sheets have wrinkles, if his pajamas have seams that are even slightly uncomfortable, or if the temperature is too warm, he gets restless and struggles to sleep. He often prefers heavy blankets, even in summer, as if the pressure helps him feel more secure. We’ve had to be very particular about his bedding, pajamas, and room conditions to minimize disruptions, but even then, sleep continues to be an ongoing challenge. 

Clinician: How did he react to being comforted when he was upset? Did he seek comfort from you or others? 

Mum: Not really. If he got hurt or was upset, he wouldn’t run to me for a hug like other kids do. He would sometimes just sit and cry on his own. If I tried to comfort him, he would sometimes pull away or not really respond to it. It was difficult because I wanted to help him feel better, but he didn’t seem to want physical reassurance. The only thing that sometimes helped was giving him his favorite toy—he would hold it and calm down, but he didn’t seek comfort from people the way his older sister did at that age. 

There were times when I felt like I was failing him because I couldn’t seem to comfort him the way I thought a parent should. But over time, I realized he just had different needs, and I had to find other ways to help him feel safe and calm. 

 

Communication 

Clinician: How would you describe Eddie’s language development? 

Mum: He didn’t say his first words until he was nearly three. Even now, his sentences are quite basic compared to other kids his age. When he does speak, he tends to use short phrases rather than full sentences. He sometimes struggles to find the right words, and instead of explaining something, he might just stop talking or look confused. He also mixes up pronouns a lot. For example, he might say, "You want juice" when he means "I want juice." We’ve noticed that his speech sometimes sounds scripted, almost like he’s repeating things he’s heard before rather than forming his own thoughts. 

Clinician: Does Eddie use language to communicate his needs or feelings? 

Mum: He will say what he wants, like asking for a drink or a snack, but he doesn’t often express emotions. He doesn’t tell me if he’s sad or excited unless I ask him directly, and even then, he might not always answer. If he’s upset, he tends to stay quiet or become frustrated rather than saying what’s wrong. Sometimes, he’ll just point or take my hand and lead me to what he wants rather than verbalizing it. He rarely says "I love you" or expresses affection through words, even though I know he cares about us. If he’s sick or in pain, he doesn’t always tell me—sometimes, I have to figure it out by noticing his behavior, like if he’s lying down a lot or holding his stomach. 

Clinician: How does Eddie respond when people ask him questions? 

Mum: It depends. If the question is very direct, like "Do you want juice or water?" he’ll usually answer without a problem because the response is simple and clear. But if the question is more open-ended, like "How was your day?" he often struggles. Most of the time, he’ll either ignore the question entirely or just give a short, automatic response like "fine" or "good" without elaborating. If I try to follow up with something like "What did you do at school today?" he might just shrug, say "I don’t know," or repeat the last few words of my question instead of answering it. It’s like he doesn’t know how to structure a response unless it’s very straightforward. 

If someone asks him about his feelings, like "Why are you upset?" or "What made you laugh?" he often has difficulty answering. He might just say "I don’t know" or stay quiet, even if it seems like he clearly has an emotional reaction to something. It’s not that he doesn’t have feelings—he just struggles to put them into words or explain them. Sometimes, if he’s unsure how to respond, he’ll just change the subject, walk away, or ask a completely unrelated question instead, as if avoiding the conversation entirely. 

He also has a tendency to repeat questions rather than answering them, almost as if he’s processing them aloud. For example, if I ask, "Are you hungry?" he might repeat, "Am I hungry?" before giving an answer—or sometimes he won’t answer at all. It can feel like he’s stalling for time or needs extra processing to understand what’s being asked of him. 

If he’s really focused on something, like watching his favorite show or playing with a toy, it becomes even harder to get a response. I can call his name several times, even raising my voice, and he won’t react at all. It’s like he’s completely absorbed in what he’s doing, and my words don’t register. But if I say something highly relevant to him, like "Do you want chocolate?" or "Let’s go to the park," he’ll suddenly snap out of it and respond right away. 

His ability to answer questions also depends on who’s asking. With close family members, he’s more likely to respond, even if his answers are short. But if a teacher or someone less familiar asks him something, he’s more likely to stay silent or just give a brief, automatic response to end the conversation quickly. It’s clear that communication is challenging for him, especially when the conversation requires more than just a simple choice or factual answer. 

Clinician: Does he use gestures, facial expressions, or body language to communicate? 

Mum: Not much. He doesn’t wave or point very often. His face is usually quite blank, even when he’s happy or upset. Sometimes I can tell he’s excited because he flaps his hands, but he doesn’t really smile much. When he does smile, it often seems like it’s because he knows he’s supposed to, rather than a natural reaction. He doesn’t nod or shake his head much either, and if someone waves at him, he might not wave back unless I prompt him. If he wants something, instead of pointing to it, he might just look at it intensely until I notice. He also has trouble recognizing other people’s expressions. If I’m frowning, he might not realize that means I’m upset unless I tell him directly. 

Clinician: Does he repeat phrases or words instead of responding naturally in conversations? 

Mum: Yes, sometimes he repeats things we say to him instead of answering the question. If I ask him, "Do you want a snack?" he might just repeat, "Do you want a snack?" instead of saying yes or no. It’s like he doesn’t understand how to answer properly. He also repeats phrases he’s heard from TV shows or YouTube videos, even when they don’t fit the conversation. Sometimes, he’ll say a phrase that seems unrelated to what’s happening, but it might be something he remembers from earlier. If he’s nervous or unsure of what to say, he’ll often go back to repeating something he knows rather than coming up with a new response. 

Clinician: Does Eddie engage in back-and-forth conversations with people? 

Mum: Not really. Most conversations with him are one-sided. If I ask him something, he’ll answer briefly, but he doesn’t usually ask questions back or try to keep the conversation going. He doesn’t seem interested in small talk or discussing things outside of his specific interests. If someone tries to chat with him about their day, he’ll often just go quiet or change the subject. He might talk a lot if it’s about one of his favorite topics, like space or dinosaurs, but he doesn’t really notice if the other person is interested or not. He’ll just keep going until I tell him to stop. 

Clinician: How does he handle being around people who talk a lot or conversations that involve multiple people? 

Mum: He tends to tune out when there’s too much talking around him. If there’s a group conversation, he doesn’t really join in—he just listens quietly or does his own thing. It’s like the conversation is happening around him rather than with him. If someone tries to include him, he might not respond right away, as if he didn’t hear them, even though he’s right there. Sometimes, I have to say his name a few times before he realizes he’s being spoken to. It’s not that he’s deliberately ignoring people—he just seems overwhelmed or unsure of when to speak. 

If he’s interested in something, he might suddenly interrupt with a fact about his favorite topic, even if it has nothing to do with what others are talking about. For example, if we’re discussing what to have for dinner, he might randomly say, “Did you know octopuses have three hearts?” It’s as if he’s been waiting for a gap in the conversation but doesn’t know how to smoothly join in. If the conversation isn’t about something he cares about, he usually stays quiet and just listens passively, not contributing much. 

When we’re at a family gathering or a crowded place, he almost always finds a way to withdraw. While other kids run around and play together, he’ll sit off to the side, either playing with a toy, flipping through a book, or watching something on his tablet. He seems to prefer a quiet corner where he doesn’t have to engage too much. If someone approaches him directly, he’ll sometimes talk, but only on his terms. If he’s in the middle of something, he might not even look up. 

Even in smaller groups, like when we’re at home with close family, he often stays on the periphery of conversations. If we’re all chatting at the dinner table, he’ll either eat quietly or focus on something else, like lining up his food or playing with his utensils. When he does speak, it’s usually about something specific he’s interested in rather than responding to the ongoing conversation. 

It’s not that he dislikes people—he just seems more comfortable as an observer rather than an active participant. He prefers one-on-one interactions, where the conversation is slower and more predictable. In larger groups, he tends to drift away, either physically by moving to a quieter spot, or mentally by tuning everything out. 

Clinician: Does he use tone of voice appropriately? 

Mum: Not always. Sometimes, his voice sounds flat, like he’s just saying words without much emotion. Other times, he’ll use a tone that doesn’t match what he’s saying—he might sound excited when talking about something sad, or he might sound serious when he’s trying to be funny. He doesn’t seem to realise when his tone doesn’t match the situation. Sometimes, he speaks in a sing-song voice, almost like he’s imitating a cartoon character. He also doesn’t always adjust his volume—he might whisper when he should be speaking up, or he might talk too loudly in quiet places. 

Clinician: Does Eddie understand jokes or sarcasm? 

Mum: No, not really. If someone makes a joke, he usually doesn’t react, or he takes it literally. If I say something sarcastic, he’ll just believe it’s true. One time, I said, "Oh great, more traffic!" in a sarcastic way, and he thought I was actually happy about it. He doesn’t really pick up on playful teasing either—if another child jokes with him, he might think they’re being mean and get upset. If he does laugh at something, it’s usually because he’s seen someone else laughing, not because he understands the joke. 

Clinician: Does he ever make up his own jokes? 

Mum: Occasionally, but they don’t always make sense. Sometimes, he’ll repeat jokes he’s heard before, but if he tries to make up his own, they’re usually very literal or based on things he’s memorized. He doesn’t seem to understand what makes something funny to other people. Sometimes, he laughs at things that don’t seem funny to anyone else, like a certain sound or a word he likes. 

Clinician: Have you noticed any other unusual language patterns? 

Mum: Sometimes, he talks in a very formal way, like he’s reading from a book rather than just talking naturally. He also gets stuck on certain phrases—if he learns a new word or sentence structure, he might use it over and over, even when it’s not appropriate. He also has trouble understanding when to start or stop talking. If he’s interested in something, he might go on and on without noticing that the other person isn’t listening anymore. 

Clinician: Thank you. This is very helpful in understanding Eddie’s communication style. 

 

III. Social Development 

Clinician: How does Eddie interact with other children? 

Mum: He struggles to join in with other children and tends to prefer playing alone. He often doesn’t seem to understand the natural flow of social play—how to share, take turns, or follow the unspoken rules of group games. If another child wants to play with the same toy as him, he doesn’t instinctively know how to handle it. Instead of negotiating, suggesting they take turns, or finding a way to play together, he usually reacts with frustration. If someone takes a toy from him, even if they don’t mean to upset him, he gets very distressed. Sometimes, he will cry, freeze up, or walk away rather than trying to work out a solution. It’s as if he doesn’t have the words or strategies to handle these kinds of situations. 

He also struggles with understanding the rules of social play. If the other children are playing a structured game, he might not fully grasp how it works, even if they explain it to him. If the game’s rules change or become more flexible—as kids often do when making up games on the spot—he can become visibly confused or overwhelmed. He sometimes just stops playing altogether rather than trying to adapt to the new rules. 

Even when he wants to be part of a group, he doesn’t always know how to approach other children or start a conversation. Instead, he often stands nearby, watching other kids play but not actively joining in. It’s clear he enjoys observing and is interested in what they’re doing, but he rarely initiates interaction himself. If another child invites him to play, he may hesitate or take a long time to respond, as if he’s unsure of what to do. When he does participate, he often prefers to follow rather than take the lead, but if the game becomes too unpredictable or social expectations become too complex, he withdraws. 

Because of these difficulties, he often plays independently, preferring activities that don’t require much social interaction. He enjoys lining up his toys, building things, or engaging in repetitive play rather than cooperative games. If he does play alongside other children, it’s more like parallel play—where he’s doing his own thing near them but not necessarily with them. He’s much more comfortable in one-on-one interactions, especially with adults or familiar children who understand his needs and don’t pressure him to engage in ways that feel unnatural to him. 

Clinician: Does he show interest in making friends? 

Mum: He says he wants friends, but when he’s around other kids, he doesn’t seem to know what to do. He stands near them but doesn’t engage in the game or conversation. Sometimes he will try to copy what they are doing, but it seems like he’s unsure of how to participate. If the other kids don’t respond positively, he’ll withdraw and play on his own. He also has difficulty understanding social cues, like when someone is joking versus being serious. If someone teases him in a friendly way, he often takes it literally and gets upset. He has one or two children at school who he calls friends, but they don’t really play together in a typical way. It’s more that they sit next to each other in class or occasionally share an interest in the same subject. 

Clinician: How does Eddie respond to adults? 

Mum: He’s polite but doesn’t seek out conversations. He’ll answer questions but rarely initiates interactions. If an adult asks him something, he’ll reply, but he doesn’t ask questions back or try to continue the conversation. When adults make small talk with him, he usually gives short answers and doesn’t seem to know how to extend the interaction. He sometimes seems uninterested in people unless they’re talking about something he enjoys, like trains or dinosaurs. If he’s asked to say hello to someone, he will do it, but it feels very scripted, like he’s just saying the words without really engaging with the person. 

Clinician: Does he make eye contact when speaking with people? 

Mum: No, not really. He tends to look away or focus on something else while talking. If I ask him to look at me, he’ll glance up for a second but then look away again. Sometimes he looks at people’s mouths instead of their eyes when they’re talking, and if he’s feeling uncomfortable, he’ll turn his body away slightly. He doesn’t seem to realise that eye contact is expected in conversations. Sometimes he even closes his eyes while talking, as if it’s easier for him to focus that way. If he’s watching TV or playing with a toy, he can talk without looking at someone at all, and he doesn’t seem to notice that this is unusual. 

Clinician: How does he react in group settings, like birthday parties or family gatherings? 

Mum: He gets overwhelmed easily, especially in loud, busy environments. If there are a lot of kids running around and making noise, he tends to withdraw rather than joining in. He might cover his ears with his hands, look down at the floor, or find a quiet corner to sit in where he can observe without being directly involved. It’s as if all the movement, noise, and unpredictability become too much for him to process at once. Sometimes, he will completely shut down, becoming unresponsive or seeming lost in his own world. Other times, he might become irritable or ask to leave because he just can’t handle the overstimulation any longer. 

He prefers structured activities where he knows exactly what’s expected of him. For example, he does much better in a small group activity where there’s a clear set of instructions rather than free play, where he has to navigate social interactions on his own. He enjoys watching other children play, often standing to the side and observing, but he won’t join in unless someone explicitly invites him. Even then, he may hesitate before participating, and if things get too chaotic, he might pull away again. 

At birthday parties, he’s okay as long as there’s a predictable schedule. Sitting for food and cake, for example, is fine because it’s structured and follows a routine. However, he struggles with the unstructured parts, like when kids run around playing party games with constantly changing rules. If it’s a game where he gets a clear turn, like pass the parcel, he can manage, but if it’s a fast-paced game requiring quick reactions—such as musical chairs or tag—he often freezes or gets frustrated because he can’t process everything happening at once. 

He also dislikes surprises or deviations from what he expects. If something happens differently than he anticipated, he can become visibly upset. For example, if he thought the birthday child would open presents at the end of the party but they decide to do it earlier, he might react by getting anxious or even crying. It’s not that he doesn’t enjoy celebrations—it’s that unpredictability throws him off and makes it hard for him to adjust. He thrives when he knows exactly what to expect and struggles when things don’t go according to plan. 

Clinician: How does Eddie handle new social situations? 

Mum: He’s very hesitant. If we go somewhere new, he tends to stick close to me and doesn’t approach other children on his own. He likes familiarity, so if we go to the same place multiple times, he gets more comfortable, but it takes a while. If a child tries to talk to him, he might freeze or take a long time to respond. Sometimes he responds with a fact about something he’s interested in rather than answering what was asked. He also struggles with unpredictable social interactions—if someone suddenly asks him a question he wasn’t expecting, he might just not respond at all. He does better when he knows exactly what’s going to happen, so things like school assemblies or new group activities can be difficult for him. 

Clinician: Does he prefer playing with certain types of children? 

Mum: Yes, he does better with children who are calm and structured in their play. If another child is very energetic or unpredictable, Eddie tends to avoid them. He also does well with adults or older children who are patient and guide him through interactions. When a peer tries to engage him in a game with clear rules, he might participate more readily. He doesn’t do well with children who are very dominant in play or who change the game a lot. If he’s playing a board game, for example, he needs the rules to be followed exactly, and if another child starts making up their own rules, he gets really upset. 

Clinician: Have you noticed any unusual social behaviors, such as talking too much about a specific topic? 

Mum: Yes, if he’s interested in something, he will talk about it endlessly, even if the other person isn’t interested. For example, he’s obsessed with trains, and if someone mentions trains, he’ll start listing train facts without noticing if the person wants to talk about something else. If someone tries to change the subject, he’ll often bring it back to trains. It’s like he doesn’t realise that conversations should be a two-way exchange. If he’s in a group conversation, he often doesn’t contribute unless he hears a keyword that relates to one of his interests, and then he jumps in with a long monologue about it. He also sometimes repeats phrases or scripts from shows he’s watched, especially if he’s not sure what to say in a conversation. It’s almost like he’s using those phrases as a way to fill in the gaps. 

Clinician: Have there been any other concerns about his social development? 

Mum: He doesn’t seem to pick up on emotions very well. If someone is sad or upset, he doesn’t always realise unless they tell him directly. If another child cries, he might look confused rather than comforting them. If he accidentally hurts someone, he sometimes doesn’t realise it unless I point it out. He also struggles with personal space—he sometimes stands too close to people or doesn’t understand when someone wants to be left alone. He’s getting better with practice, but it’s still something we have to remind him about a lot. 

Clinician: Thank you for sharing all of that. This helps me get a better understanding of how Eddie interacts socially. We’ll continue to explore these patterns as we go through the rest of the assessment. 

 

IV. Repetitive Behaviours and Interests 

Clinician: Does Eddie have any specific interests or hobbies? 

Mum: Yes, he has a really strong interest in trains—it's been his favorite topic for as long as I can remember. He could spend hours watching train videos on YouTube, especially ones that show different train models, railway journeys, or time-lapse footage of trains moving through different landscapes. He’s particularly fascinated by high-speed trains and historic steam locomotives, and he can recall an impressive number of facts about them. He knows the names of various trains, railway systems from different countries, and even small details like when certain models were built, their top speeds, and which lines they operate on. 

If we visit a train station, it’s one of the few places where he’s completely engaged and happy. He can stand on the platform for hours, watching the trains arrive and depart without getting bored. He pays close attention to the details—listening for the announcements, noting the platform numbers, and sometimes even predicting which train will arrive next based on the schedule. He prefers to stand as close as possible to the edge of the platform (while still being safe), and he often brings a notebook to write down train numbers or sketch out what he sees. If we take a train journey, he will spend the entire time looking out of the window, tracking the route, and pointing out landmarks or changes in the track layout. 

His love for trains extends beyond just watching them—he also enjoys drawing them, and his sketches are incredibly detailed. He carefully plans out the tracks, carriages, and even includes tiny details like station signs, overhead cables, and signal lights. He spends a lot of time making sure each train is drawn to scale, often referencing pictures or videos to get the smallest details right. He even creates his own imaginary railway maps, designing fictional train routes and stations with as much thought as a real railway planner. 

Trains dominate many of his conversations. If someone mentions anything remotely related to trains, he immediately perks up and wants to share what he knows. Even if the conversation isn’t about trains, he often finds a way to bring them up—sometimes changing the subject completely to talk about a new fact he just learned. It’s clear that his passion for trains isn’t just a passing interest—it’s an all-consuming fascination that shapes the way he experiences the world. 

Clinician: Does he get upset if he can’t engage in his preferred activities? 

Mum: Yes, very much so. If we tell him he has to turn off his train videos, he can get very upset, sometimes crying or shouting. He doesn’t understand why he has to stop, especially if it’s something like bedtime or mealtime. He also struggles if his routine around trains is interrupted—if he expects to go to the train station on Saturday but for some reason we can’t, he finds it really hard to cope. He’ll ask repeatedly why we can’t go and will stay upset about it for the whole day. It’s not just disappointment; it’s like he doesn’t have a way to move on from the frustration. 

Clinician: Has his interest in trains remained consistent over time, or has he had other strong interests in the past? 

Mum: Trains have been his biggest interest for a long time, but he has had other phases. For a few months last year, he was really into dinosaurs. He memorised the names of different species and could tell you what time period they lived in. Before that, he was fascinated by planets and space, and he learned all about the solar system. His interests tend to be very deep and specific—he doesn’t just like a topic, he immerses himself in it completely. But eventually, he moves on to a new obsession. Right now, it’s back to trains, and I don’t see that changing anytime soon. 

Clinician: How does he react when someone else isn’t interested in what he’s talking about? 

Mum: He doesn’t really notice. He’ll talk about trains even if the other person isn’t engaging. He’ll tell his younger sister all about different train routes, even though she isn’t paying attention. If we try to change the subject, he might steer it back to trains or just keep talking about them as if he didn’t hear us. He doesn’t seem to pick up on when someone has lost interest. If we’re out and he hears someone mention trains, even if they’re talking to someone else, he’ll jump into the conversation and start telling them facts. 

Clinician: Does he get upset if his routine is disrupted? 

Mum: Absolutely. If something unexpected happens, he finds it really difficult to cope. He thrives on predictability and routine, and any deviation from what he expects can cause significant anxiety. He likes to know exactly what’s happening each day, and if things don’t go as planned, he becomes visibly distressed. Even small, seemingly insignificant changes can unsettle him. For example, if we suddenly have to leave the house earlier than usual, he’ll get upset, sometimes refusing to put on his shoes or insisting that we stick to the usual time. If I tell him we’re running late, instead of hurrying, he might freeze, cry, or repeatedly ask why we’re leaving early, struggling to process the shift in schedule. 

Even minor changes in his daily routine can be triggering. If I serve his breakfast on a different plate than usual, he’ll immediately notice and might push it away, refusing to eat until I fix it. If we run out of his usual brand of cereal and offer a slightly different one, he may react with frustration or sadness, sometimes asking repeatedly why we don’t have the right one. It’s not just about personal preference—he seems genuinely unsettled by any change, as if his sense of stability has been disrupted. 

He also notices and reacts strongly to unexpected changes in familiar surroundings. If we take a different route to school, even if it’s only a small detour, he’ll notice immediately. He might ask, “Why are we going this way?” and then repeat the question several times, even after I’ve given him an explanation. He struggles to let it go, almost as if he needs constant reassurance that everything is still okay. Similarly, if furniture in the house is moved, or if we change the order of activities in his bedtime routine, he gets anxious and sometimes refuses to cooperate until things feel ‘right’ again. 

Larger disruptions, like canceled plans or an unexpected visitor, can be especially challenging. If we had planned to go to the park but suddenly need to run errands instead, he might have a meltdown, crying and repeating that he wanted to go to the park. He struggles to adapt quickly and often needs significant time and preparation before changes occur. We’ve learned that giving him advance notice and explaining changes in detail can sometimes help, but he still finds it difficult when things don’t go as expected. 

Clinician: How does he handle transitions between activities? 

Mum: Transitions are one of the hardest things for him. If he’s playing with his trains and we ask him to stop, he finds it incredibly difficult. He needs a lot of warnings before he can switch to something else. We try to tell him things like, “Five more minutes,” but even then, he often struggles when the time is up. If we ask him to do something different before he’s ready, he can have a meltdown. When he was younger, we had to physically carry him out of the house a few times because he refused to stop what he was doing. 

Clinician: Have you noticed him repeating certain movements or sounds? 

Mum: Yes, he flaps his hands a lot, especially when he’s excited. If he’s watching trains, he’ll sometimes rock back and forth slightly. He also hums to himself frequently, especially when he’s focused on something. When he’s feeling stressed, he tends to tap his fingers against his leg or pace around the room. He also repeats phrases he’s heard from TV shows or past conversations, even if they don’t fit the situation. If he’s particularly happy, he might jump up and down while flapping his hands. 

Clinician: Does he engage in repetitive play or activities? 

Mum: Definitely. When he plays with his toy trains, he lines them up in a very specific order. If anyone moves them, he gets upset and has to fix them immediately. He doesn’t do much pretend play—he doesn’t act out stories or scenarios with the trains, he just arranges them and watches them go around the tracks. When he plays with other toys, he tends to focus on one aspect, like spinning the wheels on a car instead of rolling it along the floor. He likes things to be done in a specific way, and if they aren’t, he finds it very distressing. 

Clinician: Does he have any sensory preferences or aversions? 

Mum: He doesn’t like loud noises. If a siren goes off, he covers his ears and gets very distressed. He also doesn’t like the sound of hand dryers in public toilets, so we have to avoid using them. He prefers certain textures—he always wants to wear the same kind of soft T-shirts and refuses to wear anything scratchy. When it comes to food, he has a very limited diet and doesn’t like trying new things. If something looks or smells different from what he’s expecting, he won’t eat it. 

Clinician: How does he handle social situations when his interests aren’t involved? 

Mum: If the topic isn’t something he’s interested in, he tends to zone out. He won’t really engage in the conversation unless someone brings up trains or another favourite topic. In group situations, he often seems lost and doesn’t join in. If other kids are playing a game, he won’t take part unless it’s something structured that he understands. He’s very literal, so if another child is joking, he might not realise and take it seriously. He also struggles with back-and-forth conversation—he either talks a lot about his interests or doesn’t say much at all. 

Clinician: Overall, how would you describe his repetitive behaviours and interests? 

Mum: They’re a big part of his life. His interests are intense, often becoming all-consuming, and he spends a huge amount of time engaging with them. When he’s interested in something, it’s not just a hobby—it’s a deep fixation that dominates his thoughts and conversations. He can talk about his favorite topics for hours without losing enthusiasm, sometimes repeating the same facts or stories multiple times. If he’s watching a video or reading about something he loves, it’s very difficult to pull him away from it. If he’s interrupted while engaging with his interest, he often becomes frustrated or upset, struggling to shift his attention to something else. 

He also has strong routines and struggles when they’re disrupted. He prefers to do things in a very specific order and finds comfort in predictable patterns. If something in his routine changes unexpectedly—whether it’s a different breakfast, a slight alteration to his schedule, or even a change in the placement of objects in his room—he reacts strongly and can become anxious or agitated. 

His repetitive behaviors, like hand-flapping and pacing, are very noticeable, especially when he’s feeling excited, overwhelmed, or anxious. These behaviors seem to help him regulate his emotions, and he often does them unconsciously. They become more intense when he’s highly stimulated, such as when he’s eagerly talking about his interests or feeling particularly nervous about something. 

Clinician: Thank you for sharing all of this. It gives us a much clearer picture of how Eddie experiences the world.
