Clinician: Thank you for coming in today. I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me about Eddie. I’ll be asking a series of questions about his development, behaviour, and any concerns you might have. This will help us understand his strengths and challenges so that we can provide the right kind of support. If at any point you need me to clarify a question, please feel free to ask. Let’s start with his early development. 

 

I. Early Development 

Clinician: When did you first start noticing any concerns about Eddie’s development? 

Mum: I think it was around 18 months old. He wasn’t speaking as much as other children his age, and he didn’t seem to use gestures like pointing or waving. I also noticed he didn’t respond to his name very often. It was subtle at first, and I thought maybe he was just a quiet baby. But as time went on, I started noticing how different he was compared to other children in the playgroup. 

Clinician: Was he meeting his physical developmental milestones, such as crawling, walking, and sitting up? 

Mum: Yes, mostly. He started crawling at around 10 months, which seemed typical, and he walked around 14 months, so there wasn’t much concern there. But his babbling and speech development seemed much slower than expected. He didn’t really engage in the usual baby talk you’d expect at that age. When he did try to speak, it was often repetitive sounds rather than words, and he didn’t mimic our speech the way other children did. I remember being reassured by friends and family that “boys sometimes talk later,” but deep down, I felt something was different. 

Clinician: Did he show any early signs of interest in social interaction? 

Mum: Not really. He seemed happy in his own world. He didn’t look up when we called his name, and he rarely responded to people trying to engage him. If we played peekaboo, he wouldn’t react much. I remember feeling concerned that he wasn’t as interactive as the other toddlers in his playgroup. When we went to family gatherings, he would prefer to sit in a corner playing with a toy rather than interact with cousins or other children. At first, I thought he was just shy, but even when kids tried to play with him, he would ignore them or move away. 

Clinician: Did he have any particular reactions to sensory experiences as a baby or toddler? 

Mum: Yes, he was very sensitive to noise. The vacuum cleaner made him scream, and he hated sudden loud sounds, like doors slamming. He also struggled with certain fabrics on his skin. Some clothes would make him very upset. If I dressed him in something with a tag or a slightly rough fabric, he would cry and pull at his clothes until I changed them. He also reacted strongly to certain textures, like sand or sticky things—he refused to touch them and would get very distressed if they got on his hands. 

Clinician: What about feeding? Did Eddie have any difficulties with eating or trying new foods? 

Mum: He was always quite picky with food. Even as a baby, he would refuse certain textures, and as he got older, he would only eat very specific foods. He doesn’t like anything mixed together, so if we give him a meal where different foods touch each other, he won’t eat it. He also gets upset if a food looks slightly different from what he expects. If we buy a different brand of a food he likes, even if it tastes the same, he sometimes refuses to eat it. I used to think it was just a phase, but he hasn’t really grown out of it. He also prefers foods with a predictable texture—crunchy foods are usually okay, but anything mushy or mixed is a challenge. 

Clinician: Were there any difficulties with sleeping patterns? 

Mum: Yes, he’s never been a good sleeper. He would wake up multiple times during the night, sometimes crying or just sitting awake in his cot. Even now, he has a lot of trouble falling asleep, and he often wakes up very early. He gets very upset if his bedtime routine changes. If we put him to bed even 15 minutes later than usual, he struggles to settle down. He also has nights where he wakes up and just stays awake for hours, sitting quietly or playing with his hands. 

Clinician: How did he react to being comforted when he was upset? Did he seek comfort from you or others? 

Mum: Not really. If he got hurt or was upset, he wouldn’t run to me for a hug like other kids do. He would sometimes just sit and cry on his own. If I tried to comfort him, he would sometimes pull away or not really respond to it. It was difficult because I wanted to help him feel better, but he didn’t seem to want physical reassurance. The only thing that sometimes helped was giving him his favorite toy—he would hold it and calm down, but he didn’t seek comfort from people the way his older sister did at that age. 

Communication 

Clinician: How would you describe Eddie’s language development? 

Mum: He didn’t say his first words until he was nearly three. Even now, his sentences are quite basic compared to other kids his age. When he does speak, he tends to use short phrases rather than full sentences. He sometimes struggles to find the right words, and instead of explaining something, he might just stop talking or look confused. 

Clinician: Does Eddie use language to communicate his needs or feelings? 

Mum: He will say what he wants, like asking for a drink, but he doesn’t often express emotions. He doesn’t tell me if he’s sad or excited unless I ask him directly, and even then, he might not always answer. If he’s upset, he tends to stay quiet or become frustrated rather than saying what’s wrong. Sometimes, he’ll just point or take my hand and lead me to what he wants rather than verbalizing it. 

Clinician: How does Eddie respond when people ask him questions? 

Mum: It depends. If the question is very direct, like “Do you want juice or water?” he’ll answer. But if it’s an open-ended question, like “How was your day?” he’ll either ignore it or just say “fine” and not elaborate. If someone asks him why he’s feeling a certain way, he might just shrug or say “I don’t know.” Sometimes, he’ll repeat the question back instead of answering it, as if he’s unsure of how to respond. 

Clinician: Does he use gestures, facial expressions, or body language to communicate? 

Mum: Not much. He doesn’t wave or point very often. His face is usually quite blank, even when he’s happy or upset. Sometimes I can tell he’s excited because he flaps his hands, but he doesn’t really smile much. When he does smile, it often seems like it’s because he knows he’s supposed to, rather than a natural reaction. He doesn’t nod or shake his head much either, and if someone waves at him, he might not wave back unless I prompt him. 

Clinician: Does he repeat phrases or words instead of responding naturally in conversations? 

Mum: Yes, sometimes he repeats things we say to him instead of answering the question. If I ask him, “Do you want a snack?” he might just repeat, “Do you want a snack?” instead of saying yes or no. It’s like he doesn’t understand how to answer properly. He also repeats phrases he’s heard from TV shows or YouTube videos, even when they don’t fit the conversation. Sometimes, he’ll say a phrase that seems unrelated to what’s happening, but it might be something he remembers from earlier. If he’s nervous or unsure of what to say, he’ll often go back to repeating something he knows rather than coming up with a new response. 

Clinician: Does Eddie engage in back-and-forth conversations with people? 

Mum: Not really. Most conversations with him are one-sided. If I ask him something, he’ll answer briefly, but he doesn’t usually ask questions back or try to keep the conversation going. He doesn’t seem interested in small talk or discussing things outside of his specific interests. If someone tries to chat with him about their day, he’ll often just go quiet or change the subject. 

Clinician: How does he handle being around people who talk a lot or conversations that involve multiple people? 

Mum: He tends to tune out when there’s too much talking around him. If there’s a group conversation, he doesn’t really join in—he just listens or does his own thing. If someone talks to him while others are speaking, he sometimes doesn’t even realise they’re talking to him. If he’s interested in something, he might interrupt with a fact about his favorite topic, but otherwise, he stays on the outside of group discussions. 

Clinician: Does he use tone of voice appropriately? 

Mum: Not always. Sometimes, his voice sounds flat, like he’s just saying words without much emotion. Other times, he’ll use a tone that doesn’t match what he’s saying—he might sound excited when talking about something sad, or he might sound serious when he’s trying to be funny. He doesn’t seem to realise when his tone doesn’t match the situation. 

Clinician: Does Eddie understand jokes or sarcasm? 

Mum: No, not really. If someone makes a joke, he usually doesn’t react, or he takes it literally. If I say something sarcastic, he’ll just believe it’s true. One time, I said, “Oh great, more traffic!” in a sarcastic way, and he thought I was actually happy about it. He doesn’t really pick up on playful teasing either—if another child jokes with him, he might think they’re being mean and get upset.  

III. Social Development 

Clinician: How does Eddie interact with other children? 

Mum: He struggles to join in. He prefers playing alone and often doesn’t understand how to share or take turns. If another child takes a toy he’s playing with, he gets very upset and doesn’t know how to express his frustration appropriately. He might cry or walk away rather than trying to negotiate or find a solution. 

Clinician: Does he show interest in making friends? 

Mum: He says he wants friends, but when he’s around other kids, he doesn’t seem to know what to do. He stands near them but doesn’t engage in the game or conversation. Sometimes he will try to copy what they are doing, but it seems like he’s unsure of how to participate. If the other kids don’t respond positively, he’ll withdraw and play on his own. He also has difficulty understanding social cues, like when someone is joking versus being serious. 

Clinician: How does Eddie respond to adults? 

Mum: He’s polite but doesn’t seek out conversations. He’ll answer questions but rarely initiates interactions. If an adult asks him something, he’ll reply, but he doesn’t ask questions back or try to continue the conversation. When adults make small talk with him, he usually gives short answers and doesn’t seem to know how to extend the interaction. 

Clinician: Does he make eye contact when speaking with people? 

Mum: No, not really. He tends to look away or focus on something else while talking. If I ask him to look at me, he’ll glance up for a second but then look away again. Sometimes he looks at people’s mouths instead of their eyes when they’re talking, and if he’s feeling uncomfortable, he’ll turn his body away slightly. He doesn’t seem to realise that eye contact is expected in conversations. 

Clinician: How does he react in group settings, like birthday parties or family gatherings? 

Mum: He gets overwhelmed. If there are a lot of kids running around and making noise, he tends to withdraw. He might cover his ears or find a quiet corner to sit in. He prefers structured activities where he knows what’s expected, rather than free play where he has to figure out social dynamics on his own. Sometimes he enjoys watching other children play but won’t join in unless someone specifically invites him. If things get too chaotic, he might ask to leave early. 

Clinician: How does Eddie handle new social situations? 

Mum: He’s very hesitant. If we go somewhere new, he tends to stick close to me and doesn’t approach other children on his own. He likes familiarity, so if we go to the same place multiple times, he gets more comfortable, but it takes a while. If a child tries to talk to him, he might freeze or take a long time to respond. Sometimes he responds with a fact about something he’s interested in rather than answering what was asked. 

Clinician: Does he prefer playing with certain types of children? 

Mum: Yes, he does better with children who are calm and structured in their play. If another child is very energetic or unpredictable, Eddie tends to avoid them. He also does well with adults or older children who are patient and guide him through interactions. When a peer tries to engage him in a game with clear rules, he might participate more readily. 

Clinician: Have you noticed any unusual social behaviors, such as talking too much about a specific topic? 

Mum: Yes, if he’s interested in something, he will talk about it endlessly, even if the other person isn’t interested. For example, he’s obsessed with trains, and if someone mentions trains, he’ll start listing train facts without noticing if the person wants to talk about something else. If someone tries to change the subject, he’ll often bring it back to trains. It’s like he doesn’t realise that conversations should be a two-way exchange. 

IV. Repetitive Behaviours and Interests 

Clinician: Does Eddie have any specific interests or hobbies? 

Mum: He loves trains and will spend hours watching videos or lining up toy trains. He knows the names of different train models and can tell you facts about various railway systems. He prefers watching the same train videos repeatedly and gets upset if we suggest watching something different. He also enjoys drawing trains and will often make detailed sketches of train tracks. If we take him to a train station, he becomes very excited and can stand watching trains for hours without losing interest. 

Clinician: Does he get upset if his routine is disrupted? 

Mum: Very much so. If we’re late for something or plans change, he’ll have a meltdown. He needs to know in advance what is happening each day, and if something unexpected comes up, he struggles to cope. For example, if we usually leave the house at 8:30 AM but one day we have to leave at 8:15 AM, he gets extremely anxious and might refuse to leave. If we change the route we take to school, he notices immediately and will ask repeatedly why we are going a different way. Even small changes, like serving his food on a different plate, can make him very upset. 

Clinician: Have you noticed him repeating certain movements or sounds? 

Mum: Yes, he flaps his hands when he’s excited and hums to himself a lot. When he watches trains, he often rocks back and forth slightly. He also paces around the room when he’s thinking or excited. If he’s stressed, he sometimes taps his fingers against his leg or makes a quiet humming noise. He also repeats phrases he’s heard from TV shows or conversations, even when they don’t fit the situation. If he’s particularly happy, he might jump up and down while flapping his hands. 

Clinician: Does he engage in repetitive play or activities? 

Mum: Yes, absolutely. When he plays with his toy trains, he often lines them up in a very specific order and gets upset if anyone moves them. He doesn’t usually engage in pretend play with the trains—he prefers to arrange them and watch them go around the tracks. If he’s playing a game, he tends to follow the same steps each time without much variation. When he plays with other toys, he often focuses on one aspect of them, like spinning the wheels on a car instead of rolling it along the floor. 

Clinician: Does he show an intense focus on specific topics or objects? 

Mum: Yes, trains are definitely his biggest interest, but he also becomes very focused on other things for periods of time. Last year, he was obsessed with dinosaurs and memorised the names of dozens of species. For a few months, he was really into numbers and would spend hours writing out number sequences. Right now, his focus is mainly on trains, but his intense interests do change from time to time. When he’s interested in something, it’s all he wants to talk about, and he doesn’t always notice if other people aren’t interested. 

Clinician: How does he react when he can’t engage in his preferred activities? 

Mum: He gets very distressed. If he wants to watch train videos and we say no, he might have a meltdown. If he’s in the middle of arranging his toy trains and we ask him to stop, he finds it really hard to move on to another activity. Sometimes, if we need to leave the house and he hasn’t finished what he was doing, he will refuse to go or get very upset. It helps if we give him warnings in advance, like telling him he has five more minutes, but transitions are always difficult.
