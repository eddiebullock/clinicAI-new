Clinician: Good afternoon, Edward. Thank you for coming in today. I appreciate you taking the time to go through this assessment. Before we begin, I want to reassure you that this is a relaxed and open conversation. I’ll be asking you questions about your experiences, both past and present, to get a clear understanding of how ADHD might be affecting you. Please feel free to be as detailed as you like. 

Edward Bullock: Thank you. I really appreciate that. It’s actually a bit of a relief to finally talk about this with someone who understands ADHD. I’ve spent years wondering if my struggles were just personal failings, but the more I’ve read, the more I’ve started recognizing patterns that seem to match what I’ve been experiencing my whole life. 

Clinician: That’s completely understandable, and many people feel the same way before getting assessed. It can be validating to put a name to those experiences. To start, can you briefly describe what led you to seek an ADHD assessment? 

Edward Bullock: Sure. I think I’ve always struggled with focus and attention, but I didn’t really connect the dots until much later in life. At school, I was always the kid who forgot homework, zoned out during lessons, or had to be reminded to pay attention. I was also really talkative and fidgety. My teachers saw me as intelligent but easily distracted, and I got a lot of feedback about ‘wasted potential.’ 

Then, at university, I started noticing the patterns more clearly. I could hyper-focus on things that interested me, like psychology and mental health research, but if something didn’t immediately grab my attention, I’d procrastinate endlessly or struggle to complete it. Group projects were difficult because I’d either dominate the conversation with my ideas or lose track of what was being discussed entirely. 

Now, in my job as a research assistant, I find it hard to structure my workload. I either get stuck on one task for hours or jump between too many things and end up feeling overwhelmed. Sometimes, I sit down to write a report and suddenly realize an hour has passed, and I’ve barely made progress. My sense of time is off, and I often get lost in my thoughts. 

Clinician: It sounds like these challenges have been persistent across different stages of your life. Would you say your difficulties with attention, organization, and time management have become more pronounced in adulthood, or were they always present? 

Edward Bullock: I think they were always there, but as a kid, I didn’t really have the self-awareness to recognize them as a problem. I just thought I was ‘bad’ at certain things. My parents would get frustrated with me for forgetting chores or losing things, and I was always being told to ‘just concentrate.’ I remember staring at my homework for hours, feeling completely stuck, but not understanding why. 

Now that I have more responsibilities, these challenges feel much bigger. At school, my parents and teachers were there to guide me, even if I struggled. Now, as an adult, it’s all on me to manage my work, deadlines, and daily life. It’s exhausting trying to keep up, and no matter how hard I try, I feel like I’m constantly behind. 

Early Signs and Childhood Experiences 

Clinician: That makes a lot of sense. Many adults with ADHD describe that feeling of always playing catch-up, despite their best efforts. Let’s go back to your childhood for a moment. Did your parents or teachers ever express concerns about your attention or activity levels when you were younger? 

Edward Bullock: My teachers did, yes. I had a lot of comments about being ‘easily distracted’ and ‘talking too much.’ Every parent-teacher evening was the same: “Edward is bright but needs to focus more. He gets distracted and needs to stay on task.” I would start assignments with enthusiasm but rarely finish them on time. I remember one teacher saying, “You have so much potential if only you’d apply yourself,” and that stuck with me. 

I was always told I needed to pay more attention or just try harder. The thing was, I wasn’t trying to be inattentive. I really wanted to do well. I wanted to focus—I just couldn’t. I’d get lost in my thoughts or distracted by something happening outside the window, and suddenly I’d missed half the lesson. 

At home, my parents didn’t really see it as a condition—just as something I needed to ‘fix.’ They’d remind me over and over again to focus, stop fidgeting, and get things done. If I forgot my homework or got sidetracked while doing chores, they’d just tell me I needed to ‘try harder.’ 

My mum used to get so frustrated with me because I’d start one thing and then move on to something else without finishing. I remember one time I was supposed to be tidying my room, and instead, I found an old book and got completely absorbed in reading it. Two hours later, my room was still a mess, and I had no idea where the time had gone. She’d walk in and just sigh, saying, “Edward, why can’t you just focus?” 

It wasn’t just schoolwork and chores, either. I’d lose things constantly—homework, books, my PE kit. I can’t even count the number of times I had to borrow a pen because I’d forgotten mine. It made me feel careless, but the truth was, I really tried to remember. It was like my brain just refused to hold onto certain details. 

I think that’s part of what made school so frustrating. I knew I was smart, and I knew I was capable, but I felt like I was constantly playing catch-up with everyone else. I’d see my classmates finishing their work on time, staying organized, remembering deadlines, and I just couldn’t seem to do the same no matter how much I wanted to. 

Even in group projects, I struggled. I had great ideas and loved contributing, but keeping track of what needed to be done, remembering meetings, and actually finishing my part on time was difficult. I’d either hyper-focus on one part and ignore everything else, or I’d forget about it until the last minute and have to rush. It led to a lot of frustration—not just for me, but for my classmates too. 

I think my parents believed I was just careless or lazy because, on the surface, it looked like I chose to get distracted or procrastinate. But the reality was, I couldn’t control it. Even when I wanted to focus, my brain would just pull me in another direction. 

Clinician: That’s a very common experience. ADHD wasn’t widely recognized in schools for a long time, especially in students who weren’t disruptive or overtly struggling academically. Looking back, were there any other behaviors that stood out? 

Edward Bullock: Definitely. I was always fidgeting, tapping my foot, playing with my hands, or shifting in my chair. Sitting still felt impossible. I’d also interrupt conversations constantly, which annoyed my teachers and classmates. I wasn’t trying to be rude—I just struggled to hold back my thoughts. 

I also had this weird habit of zoning out in class and then snapping back into focus without realizing how much time had passed. Sometimes, I’d miss half a lesson and have no idea what was going on. My friends used to joke that I had a ‘buffering brain’ because I’d ask questions about things that had just been explained. 

And I lost everything. My school bag was a disaster zone. I’d forget my books, my PE kit, even my lunch some days. If I put something down, it was like it disappeared from my memory instantly. 

Clinician: It sounds like these difficulties affected multiple aspects of your school experience. Did they continue into university and your professional life? 

Edward Bullock: Oh, absolutely. University was a real challenge. Lectures were easier because they were recorded, so I could rewatch them if I zoned out, but studying independently was hard. I’d start reading and suddenly realize I’d been staring at the same page for ten minutes without taking in a word. I tried different techniques—highlighting, making notes, even reading out loud—but nothing seemed to stick unless I was deeply interested in the topic. If the material wasn’t immediately engaging, my mind would drift, and I’d have to start over again. 

Writing essays was even worse. I struggled to organize my ideas, and I’d leave everything until the last minute. The pressure of a looming deadline sometimes helped me focus, but other times, I’d just shut down completely. I’d tell myself I had plenty of time, but suddenly the deadline would be days away, and I’d be in a complete panic. I’d end up pulling all-nighters, fueled by caffeine, trying to get my thoughts in order. Sometimes, I’d hyper-focus and write for hours straight, but other times, I’d just sit there, staring at a blank screen, feeling completely stuck. 

The worst part was that I knew I was capable of producing good work—I just couldn’t seem to do it consistently. Some essays would turn out great because I managed to hyper-focus, while others were rushed and messy. There was no in-between. 

In my job, I struggle with prioritization. I can get totally absorbed in one task and forget everything else, or I can sit down to work and feel paralyzed because I don’t know where to start. My emails pile up, my to-do lists are endless, and I’m always playing catch-up. I’ll tell myself I’m going to work on something, but then I’ll get distracted by another task, and before I know it, hours have passed. 

Meetings are difficult, too. I take notes to help me stay engaged, but sometimes, I realize I’ve drifted off and missed half of what was said. I also struggle with remembering deadlines unless I write them down in multiple places. Even then, I sometimes forget to check my reminders. 

It’s frustrating because I know I should be able to manage these things better. I see my colleagues staying on top of their workload effortlessly, and I wonder why it takes me twice the effort just to keep up. I try to be organized—I use planners, task lists, and calendar apps—but even with those tools, I still end up overwhelmed. 

Clinician: That must be incredibly frustrating. Have you developed any strategies to help manage these challenges? 

Edward Bullock: I’ve had to. Otherwise, I’d be completely lost. I use calendars, alarms, and reminders religiously. If something isn’t written down, it doesn’t exist. I break my work into smaller steps and set artificial deadlines to trick myself into starting earlier. 

I also listen to music or white noise to help me focus. Silence feels too empty, but if there’s too much background noise, I get distracted. It’s a delicate balance. 

Exercise helps too. If I don’t move around regularly, I feel restless and unfocused. I’ve learned that short breaks make me more productive in the long run. 

Clinician: That’s great that you’ve found some coping mechanisms that work for you. How do you feel ADHD has impacted you emotionally? 

Edward Bullock: Honestly, it’s exhausting. I spend so much energy just trying to keep up with life, and I often feel like I’m falling short. I’ve struggled with self-esteem because I’ve always felt like I should be able to do things better. 

I get overwhelmed easily, and when that happens, I shut down completely. Some days, I feel like my brain is working against me. It’s like trying to drive a car with an unreliable GPS—sometimes, it works fine, and other times, I’m completely lost. 

Clinician: That’s a very vivid way to put it, and it’s something a lot of adults with ADHD describe—this sense of effort not always translating into results. 

Edward Bullock: Exactly. I know I’m capable, but my brain doesn’t always cooperate. That’s why I wanted to get assessed. I want to understand what’s going on and figure out how to work with my brain instead of constantly fighting against it. 

Introduction to Inattention Symptoms 

Clinician: Edward, thank you for coming back for this session. Today, we’ll be diving deeper into your experiences with inattention. You mentioned in our last session that focus and attention have been a challenge for you for as long as you can remember. I’d like to understand more about how these difficulties show up in your daily life. 

To start, can you give me some examples of how trouble sustaining attention impacts you in different situations? 

Edward Bullock: Sure. It happens all the time, in different ways. At work, for instance, I’ll sit down with the intention of reading a research paper, but before I know it, I’ve opened five different browser tabs, clicked on an unrelated article, or started reading something completely off-topic. It’s not even intentional—I’ll just look up and realize that I’ve been off track for twenty minutes without knowing how I got there. I’ll tell myself to focus, but within minutes, the cycle repeats. 

Even in conversations, I sometimes zone out, especially if I’m not fully engaged in the topic. I’ll be listening at first, but then my mind will wander, and I suddenly realize I missed part of what the person was saying. It’s embarrassing, especially when I have to ask someone to repeat themselves. Sometimes, I’ll try to fake my way through it by nodding along, hoping they don’t notice, but I always worry that I’ll get caught. My girlfriend points it out the most—she can tell the moment I’ve stopped paying attention. 

At school, this used to happen all the time. I’d be sitting in a lesson, staring at the teacher, but my mind would be elsewhere. I’d get snapped back to reality when they asked me a question, and I’d have no idea what was going on. It made learning harder than it should have been. I had to put in extra hours just to catch up on what I had missed. 

Exams were especially difficult. I’d read a question, get distracted by my own thoughts, then suddenly realize ten minutes had passed, and I hadn’t even started writing. During revision, I’d try to study for hours, but half the time, I wasn’t actually absorbing anything. My friends could sit down, study efficiently, and be done. Meanwhile, I’d be re-reading the same paragraph over and over again, hoping something would stick. 

At work, it’s a constant battle to stay on track. If I get an email while working on a task, I’ll check it, then end up responding to a different message, then clicking on a link—before I know it, I’ve completely forgotten what I was originally doing. I’ll have multiple unfinished tasks open at once because I keep switching between them, never fully completing one before moving to the next. 

It’s not that I don’t want to focus—I do. But my brain just doesn’t cooperate. It’s like trying to hold onto water. No matter how much I try to keep my attention in one place, it slips through my fingers. 

Clinician: That must have been frustrating, especially when it came to academics. When you find yourself drifting off, do you notice any specific triggers or patterns? 

Edward Bullock: I think it’s worst when I’m not interested in something. If a topic is dry or repetitive, my brain just doesn’t seem to want to engage. I can try to force myself to focus, but after a few minutes, I’m either thinking about something completely unrelated or staring blankly at my screen. 

But when I am interested in something, the opposite happens—I hyper-focus. I can spend hours researching a niche topic or perfecting a project, but only if it’s something I care about. Unfortunately, that doesn’t help with tasks I find boring but still need to complete. 

Clinician: That makes sense. It’s common for people with ADHD to have a fluctuating ability to focus—high engagement in things they find interesting and significant difficulties with tasks that don’t naturally hold their attention. Have you developed any strategies to help manage these challenges? 

Edward Bullock: Yes, I rely heavily on external tools to keep me on track. Alarms, calendars, and lists are my lifeline. If I don’t write something down, it basically disappears from my brain. 

At work, I keep detailed to-do lists. I break tasks into smaller steps because if I just write down “finish report,” I’ll procrastinate for hours. But if I write down, “Draft introduction,” “Summarize findings,” and “Edit for clarity,” it’s easier for me to start. 

I also set reminders for everything—meetings, deadlines, even small things like taking a break or eating lunch. Otherwise, I lose track of time completely. 

Clinician: It sounds like you’ve found ways to compensate for these difficulties. Do you ever find that even with these tools, things still slip through the cracks? 

Edward Bullock: Absolutely. Sometimes, I’ll set a reminder, but when it goes off, I’ll think, I’ll do it in a minute, and then I forget. Or I’ll write something down and never actually check my list. It’s frustrating because I make these lists with the intention of staying on top of things, but if I don’t build a habit of reviewing them, they don’t help much. I’ve tried different apps and planners, but the problem isn’t the system—it’s remembering to use the system consistently. 

I also struggle with following through on things I don’t find immediately urgent. I’ll remember that I have to do something, but because it’s not pressing in that moment, I’ll put it off. Then, I’ll completely forget about it until it becomes an emergency. It’s like I need that last-minute panic to actually get something done. Without that pressure, I just keep pushing tasks to the side. 

For example, I’ll get an email asking me to submit a document by next week. Instead of handling it right away, I’ll tell myself I have plenty of time. But then, the deadline sneaks up on me, and I’m scrambling to get it done at the last second. It’s not that I don’t care—it’s just that my brain doesn’t register non-urgent tasks as important until they’re urgent. 

Even simple things, like booking a doctor’s appointment or replying to a text, fall into this pattern. I’ll think, I’ll do it later, but then later turns into never, and before I know it, I’m apologizing to someone for not getting back to them or dealing with the consequences of my procrastination. 

Clinician: That’s a very common experience with ADHD—intending to do something but struggling to convert that intention into action. What about physical objects? Do you frequently misplace things? 

Edward Bullock: All the time. I lose my phone, keys, and wallet at least once a week. My housemate jokes that I need a GPS tracker for my belongings. 

It’s like my brain doesn’t register where I put things. I’ll set my keys down while thinking about something else, and the next time I need them, I have no idea where they are. I’ll check the usual spots, and they’re not there. Then, I’ll find them in some completely random place—like the fridge or the bathroom counter—because I got distracted and put them down without thinking. 

Clinician: That must be frustrating. Do you have any organizational systems in place to help? 

Edward Bullock: I try to have designated spots for important things, like a dish for my keys by the door. But sometimes, I completely bypass that system and put things down wherever. It’s like my brain just skips the step of consciously placing things where they belong. I’ll walk in the door, get distracted by a notification on my phone or a thought popping into my head, and before I know it, my keys are on the kitchen counter, my wallet is in my jacket pocket, and my phone is somewhere in my bedroom. 

Then, when I need to leave the house, I’m scrambling to find everything. I’ll check the usual spots, but of course, they won’t be there. That’s when I go into full-on search mode, retracing my steps and checking absurd places—like the fridge or the bathroom sink—because, at this point, nothing surprises me anymore. I’ve even found my glasses in the laundry basket once. 

I’ve also started using Tile trackers on my wallet and keys, which helps when I inevitably misplace them. The problem is, I sometimes misplace my phone too, so I have to use my laptop to ping it, or worse, ask someone else to call me. And if my phone is on silent, well, that’s a whole different nightmare. 

It’s frustrating because I know the logical solution—just put things in the same place every time—but my brain doesn’t work that way. It’s like a momentary lapse of awareness happens right at the crucial second when I set something down. No matter how many systems I put in place, I always seem to find new, inventive ways to misplace my things. 

Clinician: Do you find it difficult to follow through on instructions or complete multi-step tasks? 

Edward Bullock: Yes, especially if someone gives me a long verbal list of things to do. I’ll remember the first part, but the rest just vanishes from my memory. I’ve learned to ask people to send instructions in writing so I can refer back to them. 

If I have to do something with multiple steps, I sometimes get stuck because I can’t figure out where to start. I’ll look at everything that needs to be done, feel overwhelmed, and then avoid it altogether. 

Clinician: That sounds like a mix of working memory challenges and executive dysfunction, which are both common with ADHD. When you avoid tasks, is it because you feel anxious about them, or is it more of a mental block? 

Edward Bullock: I think it’s more of a mental block. It’s like my brain won’t let me start. I know I need to do it, I know I should do it, but I just… don’t. Then, I get frustrated with myself for wasting time. 

Clinician: Let’s talk about distractions. Do you find that you’re easily thrown off by external stimuli, like background noise? 

Edward Bullock: Definitely. If I’m trying to work in a noisy café or an open office, I can’t concentrate. Even small things—like a flickering light or the sound of someone tapping their pen—can make it impossible for me to focus. 

That’s why I always wear noise-canceling headphones when I need to get serious work done. Otherwise, I get pulled in a hundred different directions. 

Clinician: Do you find that procrastination is a frequent issue for you? 

Edward Bullock: Oh, absolutely. If a task feels overwhelming or boring, I’ll put it off until the last possible second. Then, I go into panic mode and rush to finish it. 

I’ve tried different techniques to help, like the Pomodoro method—working in short bursts with breaks in between—but it only works sometimes. If I’m not in the right mindset, no technique helps. 

Clinician: How does your difficulty with attention affect your relationships? 

Edward Bullock: It’s frustrating for people around me because I’ll start a conversation but then get distracted by something else. My girlfriend has pointed out that I sometimes tune out mid-conversation and then ask her to repeat what she just said. 

I also interrupt a lot. Not because I’m trying to be rude, but because if I don’t say what I’m thinking immediately, I’ll forget. 

Clinician: Do you ever feel mentally exhausted from having to constantly redirect your attention? 

Edward Bullock: Yes, by the end of the day, my brain feels completely fried. It’s like I’ve been running on overdrive just to stay on top of everything. I spend so much energy just trying to keep myself on track that it’s draining. 

I sometimes feel like I have to work twice as hard as everyone else just to accomplish the same things. 

Clinician: That’s a very common feeling among adults with ADHD. It’s not a lack of effort—it’s that your brain processes information differently, and that takes energy. 

Introduction to Hyperactivity and Impulsivity 

Clinician: Now, let’s shift our focus to hyperactivity and impulsivity. You’ve already mentioned some difficulties with focus and attention, but I’d like to explore how hyperactivity and impulsivity present in your daily life. 

Can you describe how these symptoms affect you, both now and when you were younger? 

Edward Bullock: I’ve always had a lot of restless energy. Ever since I was a child, my parents and teachers would constantly tell me to “sit still” or “calm down.” I was always fidgeting, tapping my foot, or shifting in my chair. I would drum my fingers on my desk, shake my leg under the table, or play with my pen without realizing it. 

Even now, as an adult, I find it really difficult to sit for long periods. If I have to stay in one place—like during long meetings or conferences—I feel this strong urge to move. I shift positions, stretch, tap my pen against my notebook, or bounce my leg. If I try to suppress it, I get uncomfortable, and it becomes even harder to focus. 

Clinician: It sounds like that physical restlessness has been a consistent experience throughout your life. When you were younger, did you have difficulty with activities that required long periods of stillness? 

Edward Bullock: Oh, definitely. Sitting through lessons was really hard. I remember getting told off all the time for rocking my chair back and forth or for getting out of my seat without permission. 

I found assemblies or long car rides especially frustrating. I’d start shifting around, and my parents would tell me to stop moving. But the more I tried to stop, the more uncomfortable I felt. It was like an itch I couldn’t scratch—I just had to move. 

That’s why I loved PE and sports. Those were the only times I felt like I could channel all that energy into something productive. I played football, swam, and ran track. Being active helped take the edge off. 

Clinician: That’s a common experience for people with ADHD. Movement often helps regulate attention and energy levels. Do you still find that physical activity helps now? 

Edward Bullock: Yes. If I don’t get some form of exercise during the day, I get even more restless. I try to go for a run in the mornings or hit the gym after work. It helps me feel more balanced, but even with exercise, I still fidget a lot. 

 

Clinician: You mentioned struggling to sit still in meetings. Do you experience an internal sense of restlessness, even if you’re not physically moving? 

Edward Bullock: Absolutely. If I’m in a situation where I have to sit for a long time—like in a long meeting or during a lecture—I feel this intense need to move. It’s not just physical; it’s mental too. My thoughts start racing, and I feel like I need to do something. 

I sometimes find myself getting up and pacing around just to reset my focus. If I force myself to stay in one place, I start feeling really antsy. The longer I try to suppress it, the worse it gets, and eventually, I stop listening to what’s going on because I’m too focused on how restless I feel. 

Clinician: That must be frustrating, especially in professional settings. Do you find ways to manage this during work meetings or when you need to stay still for a while? 

Edward Bullock: I try. I take notes during meetings, not necessarily because I need them, but because the act of writing keeps my hands busy and helps me stay engaged. If I’m listening to a long presentation, I’ll doodle in the margins of my notebook. 

I’ve also started using a standing desk at work. If I feel restless, I can stand and shift my weight around instead of fidgeting in my chair. 

Clinician: Those sound like effective coping strategies. Do you ever feel like your need to move interferes with work or social situations? 

Edward Bullock: Sometimes. I’ve noticed that in casual conversations, I have to make a conscious effort to stand still or sit properly. If I’m talking to someone one-on-one, I sometimes sway slightly or move my hands a lot. I’ve caught people looking at my hands while I talk, which makes me self-conscious. 

It’s not that I’m trying to be overly animated—it just happens. I’ll be explaining something, and before I know it, my hands are gesturing all over the place. Sometimes, I catch myself rocking back and forth slightly, shifting my weight from one foot to the other, or even pacing if I’m standing. If I try to stop moving entirely, I feel this strange, uncomfortable build-up of energy, like I physically need to move in order to keep thinking clearly. 

In group settings, I try to keep my movements subtle, but I know I still fidget a lot. I’ll tap my fingers against the table, bounce my leg, or adjust my posture repeatedly. If I’m sitting, I tend to reposition myself constantly—crossing and uncrossing my legs, leaning forward, then leaning back. It’s like my body is always looking for a more comfortable position, but it never quite finds one. 

I’ve also noticed that when I’m really engaged in a conversation, I tend to lean in too much or nod excessively. I do it because I’m interested, but I think it sometimes comes across as intense. And if I get excited about something, I have to remind myself not to interrupt or talk too fast. It’s a tricky balance between wanting to stay engaged and making sure I don’t make other people uncomfortable. 

Clinician: Let’s talk about impulsivity. Do you find that you act or speak without thinking? 

Edward Bullock: Yes, and it’s something I’ve had to work on. In conversations, I tend to interrupt people. It’s not that I don’t care about what they’re saying—I just get excited, and my brain jumps ahead. Before I know it, I’m speaking over them. 

I’ve been told before that I don’t listen properly because I’ll finish someone’s sentence or jump in with my own thought before they’re done. I don’t mean to be rude, but I think my brain moves faster than the conversation, and I feel like I need to say my thought before I forget it. 

Clinician: Has this caused any challenges in your personal relationships? 

Edward Bullock: Yes, my girlfriend has pointed it out a lot. She’ll be telling me something, and I’ll suddenly blurt out a related thought, completely derailing the conversation. She finds it frustrating because she feels like I’m not giving her space to finish. 

I’ve also had friends joke about how I “talk a mile a minute” or how I don’t let people finish their sentences. I try to catch myself, but sometimes I don’t realize I’ve done it until I see someone’s expression change. 

 

Clinician: Aside from conversations, do you experience impulsivity in other areas, like decision-making or spending? 

Edward Bullock: Oh, spending is a big one. I’ve made so many impulsive purchases that I regretted later. If I see something online that looks interesting, I’ll buy it without really thinking about whether I need it. 

I’ve signed up for courses I never completed, bought gadgets that I barely use, and even booked spontaneous trips without fully considering the financial impact. I’m better at controlling it now, but there are still times when I get caught up in the moment and make purchases that I later regret. 

Clinician: Have you put any strategies in place to help curb impulsive spending? 

Edward Bullock: I try to follow a rule where if I see something I want to buy, I wait 24 hours before making the purchase. That way, I have time to think about whether I really need it. I’ve also started setting budgets and tracking my expenses more closely. 

Clinician: That’s a great approach. Have you noticed impulsivity affecting your professional life as well? 

Edward Bullock: Sometimes. At work, I can get so excited about a new idea that I blurt it out without fully thinking it through. I’ve had moments where I suggest something in a meeting and then realize later that I should have considered the details more carefully. 

It’s not that I don’t think things through—it’s just that my brain moves faster than my ability to filter my thoughts. If I have an idea, I feel like I need to say it immediately before I forget it. That urgency sometimes makes me overlook key details or jump ahead too quickly. I’ve had instances where I pitch an idea, and my manager asks me, “Okay, but how would that actually work?” and I suddenly realize I haven’t fully thought it through. I get so caught up in the excitement that I don’t always consider the logistics. 

I’ve been trying to work on this by taking a moment before speaking, but it’s not always easy. When I force myself to pause, sometimes the conversation moves on, and I feel like I’ve missed my chance to contribute. It’s a tricky balance—I don’t want to blurt things out, but I also don’t want to stay silent and regret it later. 

I also tend to take on too much at once. If someone asks for help with something, I’ll say yes right away, even if I’m already swamped with my own tasks. Then, I get overwhelmed because I’ve overcommitted. I think part of it is that I genuinely like being helpful, and I get excited about new projects, but I don’t always stop to consider whether I actually have the time or capacity. 

There have been weeks where I’ve taken on so many side tasks that I’ve struggled to complete my main responsibilities. I’ll have a to-do list packed with different priorities, and instead of carefully managing my workload, I end up feeling paralyzed because I don’t know where to start. Then, deadlines creep up, and I’m scrambling to finish everything at the last minute. 

I’ve been trying to improve by setting clearer boundaries and reminding myself that it’s okay to say no. I’m also working on being more realistic about my capacity. But it’s difficult because my instinct is still to say yes first and figure out the logistics later—even when I know that’s what gets me into trouble in the first place. 

Clinician: Do you find it difficult to relax? 

Edward Bullock: Yes, winding down is hard for me. My mind is always buzzing with ideas, thoughts, or things I need to do. 

Even when I’m supposed to be relaxing, like watching TV or reading a book, I feel like I should be doing something productive. I’ll start watching a movie, but after 15 minutes, I get restless and pick up my phone or start pacing around. 

Clinician: What about sleep? Does your hyperactivity impact your ability to rest? 

Edward Bullock: Definitely. It takes me a long time to fall asleep because my brain doesn’t want to switch off. I’ll lie in bed thinking about random things, and before I know it, an hour has passed. 

It’s not just small thoughts either—it’s like my brain picks the most inconvenient time to process everything. I’ll start replaying conversations from the day, analyzing what I said and wondering if I sounded weird. Or I’ll suddenly remember a random task I forgot to do, and then I’ll feel anxious about it, even though there’s nothing I can do at that moment. 

Sometimes, I get stuck in a spiral where I plan things out in my head—what I need to do tomorrow, how I should structure an email, or even imaginary scenarios that have no real purpose. It feels productive in the moment, but it’s just my brain tricking me into staying awake longer. 

I’ve tried different strategies to wind down, like reading before bed or listening to calming music, but they only work if I catch myself early. If I’m already in overthinking mode, it’s really hard to snap out of it. Even when I’m exhausted, I find myself staring at the ceiling, mentally running through every unfinished task or random thought that pops into my head. 

And when I do finally fall asleep, it’s not always restful. I wake up feeling like I haven’t fully switched off, like my brain kept going in the background. It makes mornings tough because I often wake up groggy, already feeling like I’m behind before the day has even started. 

Clinician: Edward, now that we’ve explored your symptoms in detail, I’d like to talk about how ADHD affects your day-to-day life. You mentioned earlier that these challenges impact multiple areas—work, relationships, and daily routines. 

Can you give me some specific examples of how ADHD influences your ability to function in different aspects of life? 

Edward Bullock: Honestly, it affects everything—work, relationships, daily tasks. I feel like ADHD isn’t just about struggling to pay attention. It’s about how hard it is to get through life without constantly feeling like I’m behind or forgetting something important. 

At work, I struggle with task completion and organization. I often start projects with enthusiasm, but I quickly get distracted or overwhelmed by the details. Sometimes I hyper-focus on something and lose track of time, which makes me fall behind on other tasks. Other times, I procrastinate for so long that I have to rush to meet deadlines. 

In relationships, it’s frustrating because I don’t mean to ignore people, but I sometimes forget important details or zone out mid-conversation. It’s not that I don’t care—I just get distracted or my mind jumps ahead to another thought before I realize I’ve lost the thread of the conversation. 

Even simple things like grocery shopping can become overwhelming if I don’t have a list. I’ll walk into the store with a clear idea of what I need, but as soon as I see all the options, I forget half of it and end up buying random things I don’t need. 

 

Coping Mechanisms and Strategies 

Clinician: It sounds like these challenges can create a lot of stress in your daily life. Have you developed coping mechanisms that help you manage these difficulties? 

Edward Bullock: Yes, I’ve had to put a lot of strategies in place just to stay on top of things. 

I rely heavily on structured routines, alarms, and reminders. My phone is my lifeline—I set alarms for everything, from meetings to when I need to take a break. If something isn’t in my calendar, it basically doesn’t exist. 

I also use productivity tools to manage tasks. Apps like Trello and Notion help me break big projects into smaller, more manageable tasks so I don’t feel overwhelmed. I try to structure my day with clear time blocks, but even then, it’s easy to get sidetracked. 

Exercise is a big one for me. I’ve found that physical activity helps with my restlessness. If I don’t get some form of exercise, I feel like I have too much pent-up energy, and my focus is even worse. Running or going to the gym makes a noticeable difference. 

I’ve also had to develop workarounds for things like losing items. I have a designated place for everything—keys go in the same bowl by the door, my wallet always stays in my bag. Otherwise, I’d spend half my day looking for things. 

Clinician: That’s great to hear. It sounds like you’ve put a lot of effort into managing your symptoms. Have these strategies been effective, or do you still feel like ADHD impacts your functioning significantly? 

Edward Bullock: They help, but ADHD is still a constant battle. Even with all these systems in place, I still forget things or get overwhelmed. 

For example, I’ll set a reminder for an important task, but if I’m in the middle of something else when it goes off, I’ll ignore it and then completely forget about it later. Or I’ll put things on a to-do list but then get overwhelmed by how many things I need to do, so I procrastinate instead of tackling them. 

So, while these coping strategies help me stay somewhat organized, they don’t solve the underlying issue. It still takes a lot of effort just to function at the same level as everyone else. 

 

Medical History 

Clinician: That makes a lot of sense. It’s clear that ADHD is something you’ve had to actively work around rather than something that just disappears with effort. 

I’d like to shift gears a bit and ask about your medical history. Do you have any history of medical conditions or past surgeries? 

Edward Bullock: No significant medical issues. I had a minor surgery on a tooth a while back, but nothing major. 

I did have a bout of costochondritis a couple of years ago. It’s an inflammation of the cartilage in the rib cage, and it caused chest pain that initially freaked me out. I went to the doctor, and they confirmed it wasn’t anything serious—just discomfort that would go away on its own. It lingered for a few months, though, and there were times when I’d get a sharp pain in my chest and panic for a second before remembering what it was. It made sleeping on my side uncomfortable, and I found that certain physical activities, like push-ups or stretching too far, would aggravate it. Eventually, it just faded away on its own, but it was definitely an annoying experience. 

Other than that, I haven’t had any major health problems. I get the occasional migraine, though not frequently enough for it to be a serious issue. I notice they tend to hit when I’m stressed or if I’ve had too much screen time without taking a break. When I do get them, they’re pretty intense—I feel nauseous, get light-sensitive, and need to lie down in a dark room until it passes. 

I also have a history of mild eczema, mainly on my hands in the winter. It flares up when the weather gets cold or when I use certain soaps or detergents. It’s not a big deal, but I have to be mindful about using moisturizer regularly. 

Aside from those things, I’d say I’m generally healthy. I try to exercise regularly and eat reasonably well, though I could probably improve on the sleep and stress management side of things. 

Clinician: Any history of neurological conditions, seizures, or chronic illnesses? 

Edward Bullock: No, nothing like that. 

 

Clinician: What about your family history? Is there any history of ADHD or other psychiatric conditions in your immediate or extended family? 

Edward Bullock: Yes, my paternal uncle has ADHD and dyslexia. I remember hearing stories about how he struggled in school but was always really intelligent. He’s done well for himself as an adult, but I think he still deals with some of the same challenges I do. 

Other than that, I don’t think there’s much in terms of psychiatric conditions in my family, at least nothing that was ever formally diagnosed. 

There’s also a history of cardiovascular issues on my mum’s side. My maternal grandfather had high blood pressure for most of his life and suffered a heart attack in his late 60s. My mum is careful with her diet because of that and gets regular check-ups to monitor her cholesterol. My dad’s side, on the other hand, has a history of migraines—both my dad and my uncle get them. I get them occasionally too, though not nearly as bad as they do. 

As for neurodevelopmental conditions, apart from my uncle’s ADHD and dyslexia, there hasn’t been much else formally diagnosed in the family. But given what I’ve learned about ADHD, I wouldn’t be surprised if more of my relatives had traits of it without realizing. 

Clinician: It’s interesting that your uncle has ADHD, as ADHD does have a genetic component. It’s fairly common to see it run in families. 

Did your parents ever mention concerns about your attention or behavior growing up? 

Edward Bullock: My parents always thought I was just “energetic” and “absent-minded.” They didn’t really see it as a medical issue. They thought I just needed to apply myself more. 

They were supportive, but they assumed I was just naturally a bit chaotic and would grow out of it. I don’t think they ever considered ADHD as a possibility. 

Clinician: Any history of legal trouble or criminal activity? 

Edward Bullock: No, I’ve never been arrested or had any legal issues. I’ve always been pretty careful about staying out of trouble. 

I will say that impulsivity has gotten me into social trouble before, like saying things without thinking or making reckless decisions, but nothing that’s ever been serious. 

Clinician: What is your current living situation? 

Edward Bullock: I live at home with my parents. It’s a practical decision—I’m saving money while I work as a research assistant. 

I manage daily tasks independently and don’t have any issues with financial management. I pay my own bills, handle my own responsibilities, and try to keep myself organized as best as I can. 

Clinician: Do you find living at home beneficial in terms of structure and routine? 

Edward Bullock: Yes, in some ways. Having my parents around helps with structure, and it’s nice to have people to remind me of things if I forget. But at the same time, I do want to move out eventually and have more independence. 

Clinician: Do you consume alcohol or use any substances? 

Edward Bullock: I drink socially, maybe around three units a week. I used to drink more in university, but I’ve cut back a lot since then. 

I experimented with cannabis in university, but I haven’t used it since. It never really suited me—it made me feel even more scatterbrained. 

I used to smoke, but I quit five months ago. That was tough, but I’m glad I did it. 

Clinician: That’s great to hear. Have you noticed any difference in your focus or energy levels since quitting smoking? 

Edward Bullock: A little bit, yeah. I think my energy levels are more stable, and I don’t have that mid-day slump as much. It’s also nice not to have to think about when I’ll get my next cigarette.
