    "transcript": "Clinician: Thank you for coming in today. I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me about Eddie. I\u2019ll be asking a series of questions about his development, behaviour, and any concerns you might have. This will help us understand his strengths and challenges so that we can provide the right kind of support. If at any point you need me to clarify a question, please feel free to ask. Let\u2019s start with his early development. \n\nI. Early Development \n\nClinician: When did you first start noticing any concerns about Eddie\u2019s development? \n\nMum: I think it was around 18 months old. He wasn\u2019t speaking as much as other children his age, and he didn\u2019t seem to use gestures like pointing or waving. I also noticed he didn\u2019t respond to his name very often. It was subtle at first, and I thought maybe he was just a quiet baby. But as time went on, I started noticing how different he was compared to other children in the playgroup. At first, I wondered if maybe I was overthinking it. A lot of people reassured me that all children develop at their own pace. My mum said that my brother was a late talker, so maybe Eddie was just following that pattern. But deep down, I felt something was different. \n\nThen, when we were at the playground or toddler groups, I began noticing more things. Other children would point at things they found exciting or look back at their parents to see if they were watching, but Eddie never really did that. He didn\u2019t seem to notice if I was paying attention or not. If I pointed to something, like a bird in the sky or a dog passing by, he wouldn't follow my finger or react. He just carried on with whatever he was doing. I started watching other children his age, and I saw how much they engaged with their surroundings, whereas Eddie seemed to be in his own little world. \n\nClinician: Was he meeting his physical developmental milestones, such as crawling, walking, and sitting up? \n\nMum: Yes, mostly. He started crawling at around 10 months, which seemed typical, and he walked around 14 months, so there wasn\u2019t much concern there. But his babbling and speech development seemed much slower than expected. He didn\u2019t really engage in the usual baby talk you\u2019d expect at that age. When he did try to speak, it was often repetitive sounds rather than words, and he didn\u2019t mimic our speech the way other children did. I remember being reassured by friends and family that \u201cboys sometimes talk later,\u201d but I noticed he wasn\u2019t just late\u2014his whole way of communicating seemed different. \n\nFor example, when his older sister was that age, she would babble away and try to copy what we said. If we said \u201cdog,\u201d she would try to repeat it, even if it came out as \u201cda.\u201d But Eddie didn\u2019t do that. If he made sounds, they were often the same ones over and over, and they didn\u2019t seem connected to what was happening around him. He never really tried to copy words or sounds. Even when he did say something, it often didn\u2019t seem like he was using it to communicate\u2014he would repeat words he\u2019d heard, sometimes from TV shows, but not in a way that made sense in conversation. \n\nClinician: Did he show any early signs of interest in social interaction? \n\nMum: Not really. He seemed happy in his own world. He didn\u2019t look up when we called his name, and he rarely responded to people trying to engage him. If we played peekaboo, he wouldn\u2019t react much. I remember feeling concerned that he wasn\u2019t as interactive as the other toddlers in his playgroup. When we went to family gatherings, he would prefer to sit in a corner playing with a toy rather than interact with cousins or other children. At first, I thought he was just shy, but even when kids tried to play with him, he would ignore them or move away. \n\nI remember a specific incident at a friend\u2019s birthday party when he was about two years old. There were lots of children running around playing games, and I expected Eddie to join in at some point. But instead, he sat in a corner with a toy car, spinning the wheels over and over. He didn\u2019t seem upset or overwhelmed\u2014he just wasn\u2019t interested in the other children at all. Even when another child tried to take his car or get his attention, he didn\u2019t react. It was as if they weren\u2019t there. That was one of the moments when I really started to worry. \n\nClinician: Did he have any particular reactions to sensory experiences as a baby or toddler? \n\nMum: Yes, he was extremely sensitive to noise from a very young age. Everyday household sounds that most people wouldn\u2019t even notice could make him scream or cover his ears in distress. The vacuum cleaner was one of the worst triggers\u2014he would cry, scream, and sometimes even run out of the room if he heard it turn on. It was as if the sound physically hurt him. Similarly, sudden loud noises, like doors slamming or someone dropping a pan in the kitchen, would send him into a panic. He would flinch, cover his ears tightly, and sometimes burst into tears. It got to the point where we had to warn him before doing something loud, like using a hairdryer or blender, so he could prepare himself or leave the room. \n\nHis sensitivity wasn\u2019t just to noise\u2014he also struggled a lot with certain fabrics and textures on his skin. Some clothes would make him very upset, even if they felt soft to me. If I dressed him in something with a tag or a slightly rough fabric, he would immediately start pulling at it, whining or crying, and desperately trying to get it off. Sometimes, he would scratch at his arms or neck as if the fabric was unbearably irritating. I remember one time I bought him a new sweater that I thought he would like because it was warm and cozy, but as soon as I put it on him, he started sobbing and tugging at the sleeves, saying it was \u201ctoo itchy.\u201d He refused to wear socks with seams, and we often had to cut the tags out of his clothes to make them comfortable for him. \n\nHe also had a strong reaction to certain textures, particularly things that felt sticky or grainy. He absolutely refused to touch sand, play dough, or anything slimy. I remember taking him to the beach once, thinking he would love playing in the sand like his sister did. But as soon as he stepped onto it, he froze in place and started crying. He held his hands up in the air, visibly distressed, and refused to put them down. When a small gust of wind blew sand onto his skin, he shrieked and frantically tried to brush it off. No amount of encouragement or reassurance helped\u2014he just couldn\u2019t tolerate the sensation. Eventually, we had to carry him off the beach because he wouldn\u2019t walk on it. Even at home, if he got something sticky on his hands, like yogurt or glue from a craft project, he would become extremely anxious and demand that it be washed off immediately. If he couldn\u2019t get rid of the feeling fast enough, he would start crying and shaking his hands as if trying to fling it off. It was clear that these sensations were genuinely overwhelming for him, far beyond a simple dislike or discomfort. \n\n \n\nClinician: What about feeding? Did Eddie have any difficulties with eating or trying new foods? \n\nMum: He was always quite picky with food. Even as a baby, he would refuse certain textures, and as he got older, he would only eat very specific foods. He doesn\u2019t like anything mixed together, so if we give him a meal where different foods touch each other, he won\u2019t eat it. He also gets upset if a food looks slightly different from what he expects. If we buy a different brand of a food he likes, even if it tastes the same, he sometimes refuses to eat it. I used to think it was just a phase, but he hasn\u2019t really grown out of it. \n\nHe also prefers foods with a predictable texture\u2014crunchy foods are usually okay, but anything mushy or mixed is a challenge. We had so many struggles trying to introduce new foods. He would look at them suspiciously, sometimes refuse to even touch them, and if we encouraged him to take a bite, he would gag or spit it out. \n\nClinician: Were there any difficulties with sleeping patterns? \n\nMum: Yes, he\u2019s never been a good sleeper. From infancy, sleep was a major struggle. He would wake up multiple times during the night, sometimes crying inconsolably, other times just sitting awake in his cot, staring at the ceiling or playing with his fingers. Even as a toddler, it was rare for him to sleep through the night without at least one or two disturbances. Even now, he still has difficulty falling asleep, and he often wakes up much earlier than he should. He seems to have an internal clock that doesn\u2019t match up with the rest of the family\u2014he\u2019ll wake up at 4 or 5 AM, fully alert, while the rest of us are still exhausted. \n\nHe gets very distressed if his bedtime routine changes in any way. If we put him to bed even 15 minutes later than usual, he struggles to settle, sometimes tossing and turning for hours. If we forget to do something in his routine\u2014like skipping a specific lullaby or turning off the hallway light in a different order\u2014he becomes visibly anxious and has trouble relaxing. He seems to rely on the predictability of his bedtime routine to wind down. If something disrupts it, he can become restless, irritable, or even refuse to go to bed at all. \n\nThere are nights when he wakes up in the middle of the night and just stays awake for hours. Sometimes, he lies quietly in bed, staring at his hands or rolling a small toy between his fingers. Other times, he gets up and starts pacing around his room or whispering to himself. He doesn\u2019t always cry, but it\u2019s clear he\u2019s not getting the rest he needs. It\u2019s as if his brain is still too active to switch off. \n\nI remember how exhausting it was in those early years. We tried everything\u2014soothing music, bedtime stories, white noise machines, lavender sprays, different nightlights\u2014but nothing worked consistently. Some nights, he\u2019d fall asleep easily, but then wake up two hours later, wide awake as if it were morning. On particularly bad nights, he would be up for hours, and by the time he finally fell back asleep, it would be almost time for the rest of us to wake up. It was like his body clock was completely out of sync, and no matter what we tried, he just couldn\u2019t settle into a typical sleep pattern. \n\nWe also noticed that he has an unusual sensitivity to how his sleep environment feels. If his sheets have wrinkles, if his pajamas have seams that are even slightly uncomfortable, or if the temperature is too warm, he gets restless and struggles to sleep. He often prefers heavy blankets, even in summer, as if the pressure helps him feel more secure. We\u2019ve had to be very particular about his bedding, pajamas, and room conditions to minimize disruptions, but even then, sleep continues to be an ongoing challenge. \n\nClinician: How did he react to being comforted when he was upset? Did he seek comfort from you or others? \n\nMum: Not really. If he got hurt or was upset, he wouldn\u2019t run to me for a hug like other kids do. He would sometimes just sit and cry on his own. If I tried to comfort him, he would sometimes pull away or not really respond to it. It was difficult because I wanted to help him feel better, but he didn\u2019t seem to want physical reassurance. The only thing that sometimes helped was giving him his favorite toy\u2014he would hold it and calm down, but he didn\u2019t seek comfort from people the way his older sister did at that age. \n\nThere were times when I felt like I was failing him because I couldn\u2019t seem to comfort him the way I thought a parent should. But over time, I realized he just had different needs, and I had to find other ways to help him feel safe and calm. \n\n \n\nCommunication \n\nClinician: How would you describe Eddie\u2019s language development? \n\nMum: He didn\u2019t say his first words until he was nearly three. Even now, his sentences are quite basic compared to other kids his age. When he does speak, he tends to use short phrases rather than full sentences. He sometimes struggles to find the right words, and instead of explaining something, he might just stop talking or look confused. He also mixes up pronouns a lot. For example, he might say, \"You want juice\" when he means \"I want juice.\" We\u2019ve noticed that his speech sometimes sounds scripted, almost like he\u2019s repeating things he\u2019s heard before rather than forming his own thoughts. \n\nClinician: Does Eddie use language to communicate his needs or feelings? \n\nMum: He will say what he wants, like asking for a drink or a snack, but he doesn\u2019t often express emotions. He doesn\u2019t tell me if he\u2019s sad or excited unless I ask him directly, and even then, he might not always answer. If he\u2019s upset, he tends to stay quiet or become frustrated rather than saying what\u2019s wrong. Sometimes, he\u2019ll just point or take my hand and lead me to what he wants rather than verbalizing it. He rarely says \"I love you\" or expresses affection through words, even though I know he cares about us. If he\u2019s sick or in pain, he doesn\u2019t always tell me\u2014sometimes, I have to figure it out by noticing his behavior, like if he\u2019s lying down a lot or holding his stomach. \n\nClinician: How does Eddie respond when people ask him questions? \n\nMum: It depends. If the question is very direct, like \"Do you want juice or water?\" he\u2019ll usually answer without a problem because the response is simple and clear. But if the question is more open-ended, like \"How was your day?\" he often struggles. Most of the time, he\u2019ll either ignore the question entirely or just give a short, automatic response like \"fine\" or \"good\" without elaborating. If I try to follow up with something like \"What did you do at school today?\" he might just shrug, say \"I don\u2019t know,\" or repeat the last few words of my question instead of answering it. It\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t know how to structure a response unless it\u2019s very straightforward. \n\nIf someone asks him about his feelings, like \"Why are you upset?\" or \"What made you laugh?\" he often has difficulty answering. He might just say \"I don\u2019t know\" or stay quiet, even if it seems like he clearly has an emotional reaction to something. It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t have feelings\u2014he just struggles to put them into words or explain them. Sometimes, if he\u2019s unsure how to respond, he\u2019ll just change the subject, walk away, or ask a completely unrelated question instead, as if avoiding the conversation entirely. \n\nHe also has a tendency to repeat questions rather than answering them, almost as if he\u2019s processing them aloud. For example, if I ask, \"Are you hungry?\" he might repeat, \"Am I hungry?\" before giving an answer\u2014or sometimes he won\u2019t answer at all. It can feel like he\u2019s stalling for time or needs extra processing to understand what\u2019s being asked of him. \n\nIf he\u2019s really focused on something, like watching his favorite show or playing with a toy, it becomes even harder to get a response. I can call his name several times, even raising my voice, and he won\u2019t react at all. It\u2019s like he\u2019s completely absorbed in what he\u2019s doing, and my words don\u2019t register. But if I say something highly relevant to him, like \"Do you want chocolate?\" or \"Let\u2019s go to the park,\" he\u2019ll suddenly snap out of it and respond right away. \n\nHis ability to answer questions also depends on who\u2019s asking. With close family members, he\u2019s more likely to respond, even if his answers are short. But if a teacher or someone less familiar asks him something, he\u2019s more likely to stay silent or just give a brief, automatic response to end the conversation quickly. It\u2019s clear that communication is challenging for him, especially when the conversation requires more than just a simple choice or factual answer. \n\nClinician: Does he use gestures, facial expressions, or body language to communicate? \n\nMum: Not much. He doesn\u2019t wave or point very often. His face is usually quite blank, even when he\u2019s happy or upset. Sometimes I can tell he\u2019s excited because he flaps his hands, but he doesn\u2019t really smile much. When he does smile, it often seems like it\u2019s because he knows he\u2019s supposed to, rather than a natural reaction. He doesn\u2019t nod or shake his head much either, and if someone waves at him, he might not wave back unless I prompt him. If he wants something, instead of pointing to it, he might just look at it intensely until I notice. He also has trouble recognizing other people\u2019s expressions. If I\u2019m frowning, he might not realize that means I\u2019m upset unless I tell him directly. \n\nClinician: Does he repeat phrases or words instead of responding naturally in conversations? \n\nMum: Yes, sometimes he repeats things we say to him instead of answering the question. If I ask him, \"Do you want a snack?\" he might just repeat, \"Do you want a snack?\" instead of saying yes or no. It\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t understand how to answer properly. He also repeats phrases he\u2019s heard from TV shows or YouTube videos, even when they don\u2019t fit the conversation. Sometimes, he\u2019ll say a phrase that seems unrelated to what\u2019s happening, but it might be something he remembers from earlier. If he\u2019s nervous or unsure of what to say, he\u2019ll often go back to repeating something he knows rather than coming up with a new response. \n\nClinician: Does Eddie engage in back-and-forth conversations with people? \n\nMum: Not really. Most conversations with him are one-sided. If I ask him something, he\u2019ll answer briefly, but he doesn\u2019t usually ask questions back or try to keep the conversation going. He doesn\u2019t seem interested in small talk or discussing things outside of his specific interests. If someone tries to chat with him about their day, he\u2019ll often just go quiet or change the subject. He might talk a lot if it\u2019s about one of his favorite topics, like space or dinosaurs, but he doesn\u2019t really notice if the other person is interested or not. He\u2019ll just keep going until I tell him to stop. \n\nClinician: How does he handle being around people who talk a lot or conversations that involve multiple people? \n\nMum: He tends to tune out when there\u2019s too much talking around him. If there\u2019s a group conversation, he doesn\u2019t really join in\u2014he just listens quietly or does his own thing. It\u2019s like the conversation is happening around him rather than with him. If someone tries to include him, he might not respond right away, as if he didn\u2019t hear them, even though he\u2019s right there. Sometimes, I have to say his name a few times before he realizes he\u2019s being spoken to. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s deliberately ignoring people\u2014he just seems overwhelmed or unsure of when to speak. \n\nIf he\u2019s interested in something, he might suddenly interrupt with a fact about his favorite topic, even if it has nothing to do with what others are talking about. For example, if we\u2019re discussing what to have for dinner, he might randomly say, \u201cDid you know octopuses have three hearts?\u201d It\u2019s as if he\u2019s been waiting for a gap in the conversation but doesn\u2019t know how to smoothly join in. If the conversation isn\u2019t about something he cares about, he usually stays quiet and just listens passively, not contributing much. \n\nWhen we\u2019re at a family gathering or a crowded place, he almost always finds a way to withdraw. While other kids run around and play together, he\u2019ll sit off to the side, either playing with a toy, flipping through a book, or watching something on his tablet. He seems to prefer a quiet corner where he doesn\u2019t have to engage too much. If someone approaches him directly, he\u2019ll sometimes talk, but only on his terms. If he\u2019s in the middle of something, he might not even look up. \n\nEven in smaller groups, like when we\u2019re at home with close family, he often stays on the periphery of conversations. If we\u2019re all chatting at the dinner table, he\u2019ll either eat quietly or focus on something else, like lining up his food or playing with his utensils. When he does speak, it\u2019s usually about something specific he\u2019s interested in rather than responding to the ongoing conversation. \n\nIt\u2019s not that he dislikes people\u2014he just seems more comfortable as an observer rather than an active participant. He prefers one-on-one interactions, where the conversation is slower and more predictable. In larger groups, he tends to drift away, either physically by moving to a quieter spot, or mentally by tuning everything out. \n\nClinician: Does he use tone of voice appropriately? \n\nMum: Not always. Sometimes, his voice sounds flat, like he\u2019s just saying words without much emotion. Other times, he\u2019ll use a tone that doesn\u2019t match what he\u2019s saying\u2014he might sound excited when talking about something sad, or he might sound serious when he\u2019s trying to be funny. He doesn\u2019t seem to realise when his tone doesn\u2019t match the situation. Sometimes, he speaks in a sing-song voice, almost like he\u2019s imitating a cartoon character. He also doesn\u2019t always adjust his volume\u2014he might whisper when he should be speaking up, or he might talk too loudly in quiet places. \n\nClinician: Does Eddie understand jokes or sarcasm? \n\nMum: No, not really. If someone makes a joke, he usually doesn\u2019t react, or he takes it literally. If I say something sarcastic, he\u2019ll just believe it\u2019s true. One time, I said, \"Oh great, more traffic!\" in a sarcastic way, and he thought I was actually happy about it. He doesn\u2019t really pick up on playful teasing either\u2014if another child jokes with him, he might think they\u2019re being mean and get upset. If he does laugh at something, it\u2019s usually because he\u2019s seen someone else laughing, not because he understands the joke. \n\nClinician: Does he ever make up his own jokes? \n\nMum: Occasionally, but they don\u2019t always make sense. Sometimes, he\u2019ll repeat jokes he\u2019s heard before, but if he tries to make up his own, they\u2019re usually very literal or based on things he\u2019s memorized. He doesn\u2019t seem to understand what makes something funny to other people. Sometimes, he laughs at things that don\u2019t seem funny to anyone else, like a certain sound or a word he likes. \n\nClinician: Have you noticed any other unusual language patterns? \n\nMum: Sometimes, he talks in a very formal way, like he\u2019s reading from a book rather than just talking naturally. He also gets stuck on certain phrases\u2014if he learns a new word or sentence structure, he might use it over and over, even when it\u2019s not appropriate. He also has trouble understanding when to start or stop talking. If he\u2019s interested in something, he might go on and on without noticing that the other person isn\u2019t listening anymore. \n\nClinician: Thank you. This is very helpful in understanding Eddie\u2019s communication style. \n\n \n\nIII. Social Development \n\nClinician: How does Eddie interact with other children? \n\nMum: He struggles to join in with other children and tends to prefer playing alone. He often doesn\u2019t seem to understand the natural flow of social play\u2014how to share, take turns, or follow the unspoken rules of group games. If another child wants to play with the same toy as him, he doesn\u2019t instinctively know how to handle it. Instead of negotiating, suggesting they take turns, or finding a way to play together, he usually reacts with frustration. If someone takes a toy from him, even if they don\u2019t mean to upset him, he gets very distressed. Sometimes, he will cry, freeze up, or walk away rather than trying to work out a solution. It\u2019s as if he doesn\u2019t have the words or strategies to handle these kinds of situations. \n\nHe also struggles with understanding the rules of social play. If the other children are playing a structured game, he might not fully grasp how it works, even if they explain it to him. If the game\u2019s rules change or become more flexible\u2014as kids often do when making up games on the spot\u2014he can become visibly confused or overwhelmed. He sometimes just stops playing altogether rather than trying to adapt to the new rules. \n\nEven when he wants to be part of a group, he doesn\u2019t always know how to approach other children or start a conversation. Instead, he often stands nearby, watching other kids play but not actively joining in. It\u2019s clear he enjoys observing and is interested in what they\u2019re doing, but he rarely initiates interaction himself. If another child invites him to play, he may hesitate or take a long time to respond, as if he\u2019s unsure of what to do. When he does participate, he often prefers to follow rather than take the lead, but if the game becomes too unpredictable or social expectations become too complex, he withdraws. \n\nBecause of these difficulties, he often plays independently, preferring activities that don\u2019t require much social interaction. He enjoys lining up his toys, building things, or engaging in repetitive play rather than cooperative games. If he does play alongside other children, it\u2019s more like parallel play\u2014where he\u2019s doing his own thing near them but not necessarily with them. He\u2019s much more comfortable in one-on-one interactions, especially with adults or familiar children who understand his needs and don\u2019t pressure him to engage in ways that feel unnatural to him. \n\nClinician: Does he show interest in making friends? \n\nMum: He says he wants friends, but when he\u2019s around other kids, he doesn\u2019t seem to know what to do. He stands near them but doesn\u2019t engage in the game or conversation. Sometimes he will try to copy what they are doing, but it seems like he\u2019s unsure of how to participate. If the other kids don\u2019t respond positively, he\u2019ll withdraw and play on his own. He also has difficulty understanding social cues, like when someone is joking versus being serious. If someone teases him in a friendly way, he often takes it literally and gets upset. He has one or two children at school who he calls friends, but they don\u2019t really play together in a typical way. It\u2019s more that they sit next to each other in class or occasionally share an interest in the same subject. \n\nClinician: How does Eddie respond to adults? \n\nMum: He\u2019s polite but doesn\u2019t seek out conversations. He\u2019ll answer questions but rarely initiates interactions. If an adult asks him something, he\u2019ll reply, but he doesn\u2019t ask questions back or try to continue the conversation. When adults make small talk with him, he usually gives short answers and doesn\u2019t seem to know how to extend the interaction. He sometimes seems uninterested in people unless they\u2019re talking about something he enjoys, like trains or dinosaurs. If he\u2019s asked to say hello to someone, he will do it, but it feels very scripted, like he\u2019s just saying the words without really engaging with the person. \n\nClinician: Does he make eye contact when speaking with people? \n\nMum: No, not really. He tends to look away or focus on something else while talking. If I ask him to look at me, he\u2019ll glance up for a second but then look away again. Sometimes he looks at people\u2019s mouths instead of their eyes when they\u2019re talking, and if he\u2019s feeling uncomfortable, he\u2019ll turn his body away slightly. He doesn\u2019t seem to realise that eye contact is expected in conversations. Sometimes he even closes his eyes while talking, as if it\u2019s easier for him to focus that way. If he\u2019s watching TV or playing with a toy, he can talk without looking at someone at all, and he doesn\u2019t seem to notice that this is unusual. \n\nClinician: How does he react in group settings, like birthday parties or family gatherings? \n\nMum: He gets overwhelmed easily, especially in loud, busy environments. If there are a lot of kids running around and making noise, he tends to withdraw rather than joining in. He might cover his ears with his hands, look down at the floor, or find a quiet corner to sit in where he can observe without being directly involved. It\u2019s as if all the movement, noise, and unpredictability become too much for him to process at once. Sometimes, he will completely shut down, becoming unresponsive or seeming lost in his own world. Other times, he might become irritable or ask to leave because he just can\u2019t handle the overstimulation any longer. \n\nHe prefers structured activities where he knows exactly what\u2019s expected of him. For example, he does much better in a small group activity where there\u2019s a clear set of instructions rather than free play, where he has to navigate social interactions on his own. He enjoys watching other children play, often standing to the side and observing, but he won\u2019t join in unless someone explicitly invites him. Even then, he may hesitate before participating, and if things get too chaotic, he might pull away again. \n\nAt birthday parties, he\u2019s okay as long as there\u2019s a predictable schedule. Sitting for food and cake, for example, is fine because it\u2019s structured and follows a routine. However, he struggles with the unstructured parts, like when kids run around playing party games with constantly changing rules. If it\u2019s a game where he gets a clear turn, like pass the parcel, he can manage, but if it\u2019s a fast-paced game requiring quick reactions\u2014such as musical chairs or tag\u2014he often freezes or gets frustrated because he can\u2019t process everything happening at once. \n\nHe also dislikes surprises or deviations from what he expects. If something happens differently than he anticipated, he can become visibly upset. For example, if he thought the birthday child would open presents at the end of the party but they decide to do it earlier, he might react by getting anxious or even crying. It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t enjoy celebrations\u2014it\u2019s that unpredictability throws him off and makes it hard for him to adjust. He thrives when he knows exactly what to expect and struggles when things don\u2019t go according to plan. \n\nClinician: How does Eddie handle new social situations? \n\nMum: He\u2019s very hesitant. If we go somewhere new, he tends to stick close to me and doesn\u2019t approach other children on his own. He likes familiarity, so if we go to the same place multiple times, he gets more comfortable, but it takes a while. If a child tries to talk to him, he might freeze or take a long time to respond. Sometimes he responds with a fact about something he\u2019s interested in rather than answering what was asked. He also struggles with unpredictable social interactions\u2014if someone suddenly asks him a question he wasn\u2019t expecting, he might just not respond at all. He does better when he knows exactly what\u2019s going to happen, so things like school assemblies or new group activities can be difficult for him. \n\nClinician: Does he prefer playing with certain types of children? \n\nMum: Yes, he does better with children who are calm and structured in their play. If another child is very energetic or unpredictable, Eddie tends to avoid them. He also does well with adults or older children who are patient and guide him through interactions. When a peer tries to engage him in a game with clear rules, he might participate more readily. He doesn\u2019t do well with children who are very dominant in play or who change the game a lot. If he\u2019s playing a board game, for example, he needs the rules to be followed exactly, and if another child starts making up their own rules, he gets really upset. \n\nClinician: Have you noticed any unusual social behaviors, such as talking too much about a specific topic? \n\nMum: Yes, if he\u2019s interested in something, he will talk about it endlessly, even if the other person isn\u2019t interested. For example, he\u2019s obsessed with trains, and if someone mentions trains, he\u2019ll start listing train facts without noticing if the person wants to talk about something else. If someone tries to change the subject, he\u2019ll often bring it back to trains. It\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t realise that conversations should be a two-way exchange. If he\u2019s in a group conversation, he often doesn\u2019t contribute unless he hears a keyword that relates to one of his interests, and then he jumps in with a long monologue about it. He also sometimes repeats phrases or scripts from shows he\u2019s watched, especially if he\u2019s not sure what to say in a conversation. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s using those phrases as a way to fill in the gaps. \n\nClinician: Have there been any other concerns about his social development? \n\nMum: He doesn\u2019t seem to pick up on emotions very well. If someone is sad or upset, he doesn\u2019t always realise unless they tell him directly. If another child cries, he might look confused rather than comforting them. If he accidentally hurts someone, he sometimes doesn\u2019t realise it unless I point it out. He also struggles with personal space\u2014he sometimes stands too close to people or doesn\u2019t understand when someone wants to be left alone. He\u2019s getting better with practice, but it\u2019s still something we have to remind him about a lot. \n\nClinician: Thank you for sharing all of that. This helps me get a better understanding of how Eddie interacts socially. We\u2019ll continue to explore these patterns as we go through the rest of the assessment. \n\n \n\nIV. Repetitive Behaviours and Interests \n\nClinician: Does Eddie have any specific interests or hobbies? \n\nMum: Yes, he has a really strong interest in trains\u2014it's been his favorite topic for as long as I can remember. He could spend hours watching train videos on YouTube, especially ones that show different train models, railway journeys, or time-lapse footage of trains moving through different landscapes. He\u2019s particularly fascinated by high-speed trains and historic steam locomotives, and he can recall an impressive number of facts about them. He knows the names of various trains, railway systems from different countries, and even small details like when certain models were built, their top speeds, and which lines they operate on. \n\nIf we visit a train station, it\u2019s one of the few places where he\u2019s completely engaged and happy. He can stand on the platform for hours, watching the trains arrive and depart without getting bored. He pays close attention to the details\u2014listening for the announcements, noting the platform numbers, and sometimes even predicting which train will arrive next based on the schedule. He prefers to stand as close as possible to the edge of the platform (while still being safe), and he often brings a notebook to write down train numbers or sketch out what he sees. If we take a train journey, he will spend the entire time looking out of the window, tracking the route, and pointing out landmarks or changes in the track layout. \n\nHis love for trains extends beyond just watching them\u2014he also enjoys drawing them, and his sketches are incredibly detailed. He carefully plans out the tracks, carriages, and even includes tiny details like station signs, overhead cables, and signal lights. He spends a lot of time making sure each train is drawn to scale, often referencing pictures or videos to get the smallest details right. He even creates his own imaginary railway maps, designing fictional train routes and stations with as much thought as a real railway planner. \n\nTrains dominate many of his conversations. If someone mentions anything remotely related to trains, he immediately perks up and wants to share what he knows. Even if the conversation isn\u2019t about trains, he often finds a way to bring them up\u2014sometimes changing the subject completely to talk about a new fact he just learned. It\u2019s clear that his passion for trains isn\u2019t just a passing interest\u2014it\u2019s an all-consuming fascination that shapes the way he experiences the world. \n\nClinician: Does he get upset if he can\u2019t engage in his preferred activities? \n\nMum: Yes, very much so. If we tell him he has to turn off his train videos, he can get very upset, sometimes crying or shouting. He doesn\u2019t understand why he has to stop, especially if it\u2019s something like bedtime or mealtime. He also struggles if his routine around trains is interrupted\u2014if he expects to go to the train station on Saturday but for some reason we can\u2019t, he finds it really hard to cope. He\u2019ll ask repeatedly why we can\u2019t go and will stay upset about it for the whole day. It\u2019s not just disappointment": null, " it\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t have a way to move on from the frustration. \n\nClinician: Has his interest in trains remained consistent over time, or has he had other strong interests in the past? \n\nMum: Trains have been his biggest interest for a long time, but he has had other phases. For a few months last year, he was really into dinosaurs. He memorised the names of different species and could tell you what time period they lived in. Before that, he was fascinated by planets and space, and he learned all about the solar system. His interests tend to be very deep and specific\u2014he doesn\u2019t just like a topic, he immerses himself in it completely. But eventually, he moves on to a new obsession. Right now, it\u2019s back to trains, and I don\u2019t see that changing anytime soon. \n\nClinician: How does he react when someone else isn\u2019t interested in what he\u2019s talking about? \n\nMum: He doesn\u2019t really notice. He\u2019ll talk about trains even if the other person isn\u2019t engaging. He\u2019ll tell his younger sister all about different train routes, even though she isn\u2019t paying attention. If we try to change the subject, he might steer it back to trains or just keep talking about them as if he didn\u2019t hear us. He doesn\u2019t seem to pick up on when someone has lost interest. If we\u2019re out and he hears someone mention trains, even if they\u2019re talking to someone else, he\u2019ll jump into the conversation and start telling them facts. \n\nClinician: Does he get upset if his routine is disrupted? \n\nMum: Absolutely. If something unexpected happens, he finds it really difficult to cope. He thrives on predictability and routine, and any deviation from what he expects can cause significant anxiety. He likes to know exactly what\u2019s happening each day, and if things don\u2019t go as planned, he becomes visibly distressed. Even small, seemingly insignificant changes can unsettle him. For example, if we suddenly have to leave the house earlier than usual, he\u2019ll get upset, sometimes refusing to put on his shoes or insisting that we stick to the usual time. If I tell him we\u2019re running late, instead of hurrying, he might freeze, cry, or repeatedly ask why we\u2019re leaving early, struggling to process the shift in schedule. \n\nEven minor changes in his daily routine can be triggering. If I serve his breakfast on a different plate than usual, he\u2019ll immediately notice and might push it away, refusing to eat until I fix it. If we run out of his usual brand of cereal and offer a slightly different one, he may react with frustration or sadness, sometimes asking repeatedly why we don\u2019t have the right one. It\u2019s not just about personal preference\u2014he seems genuinely unsettled by any change, as if his sense of stability has been disrupted. \n\nHe also notices and reacts strongly to unexpected changes in familiar surroundings. If we take a different route to school, even if it\u2019s only a small detour, he\u2019ll notice immediately. He might ask, \u201cWhy are we going this way?\u201d and then repeat the question several times, even after I\u2019ve given him an explanation. He struggles to let it go, almost as if he needs constant reassurance that everything is still okay. Similarly, if furniture in the house is moved, or if we change the order of activities in his bedtime routine, he gets anxious and sometimes refuses to cooperate until things feel \u2018right\u2019 again. \n\nLarger disruptions, like canceled plans or an unexpected visitor, can be especially challenging. If we had planned to go to the park but suddenly need to run errands instead, he might have a meltdown, crying and repeating that he wanted to go to the park. He struggles to adapt quickly and often needs significant time and preparation before changes occur. We\u2019ve learned that giving him advance notice and explaining changes in detail can sometimes help, but he still finds it difficult when things don\u2019t go as expected. \n\nClinician: How does he handle transitions between activities? \n\nMum: Transitions are one of the hardest things for him. If he\u2019s playing with his trains and we ask him to stop, he finds it incredibly difficult. He needs a lot of warnings before he can switch to something else. We try to tell him things like, \u201cFive more minutes,\u201d but even then, he often struggles when the time is up. If we ask him to do something different before he\u2019s ready, he can have a meltdown. When he was younger, we had to physically carry him out of the house a few times because he refused to stop what he was doing. \n\nClinician: Have you noticed him repeating certain movements or sounds? \n\nMum: Yes, he flaps his hands a lot, especially when he\u2019s excited. If he\u2019s watching trains, he\u2019ll sometimes rock back and forth slightly. He also hums to himself frequently, especially when he\u2019s focused on something. When he\u2019s feeling stressed, he tends to tap his fingers against his leg or pace around the room. He also repeats phrases he\u2019s heard from TV shows or past conversations, even if they don\u2019t fit the situation. If he\u2019s particularly happy, he might jump up and down while flapping his hands. \n\nClinician: Does he engage in repetitive play or activities? \n\nMum: Definitely. When he plays with his toy trains, he lines them up in a very specific order. If anyone moves them, he gets upset and has to fix them immediately. He doesn\u2019t do much pretend play\u2014he doesn\u2019t act out stories or scenarios with the trains, he just arranges them and watches them go around the tracks. When he plays with other toys, he tends to focus on one aspect, like spinning the wheels on a car instead of rolling it along the floor. He likes things to be done in a specific way, and if they aren\u2019t, he finds it very distressing. \n\nClinician: Does he have any sensory preferences or aversions? \n\nMum: He doesn\u2019t like loud noises. If a siren goes off, he covers his ears and gets very distressed. He also doesn\u2019t like the sound of hand dryers in public toilets, so we have to avoid using them. He prefers certain textures\u2014he always wants to wear the same kind of soft T-shirts and refuses to wear anything scratchy. When it comes to food, he has a very limited diet and doesn\u2019t like trying new things. If something looks or smells different from what he\u2019s expecting, he won\u2019t eat it. \n\nClinician: How does he handle social situations when his interests aren\u2019t involved? \n\nMum: If the topic isn\u2019t something he\u2019s interested in, he tends to zone out. He won\u2019t really engage in the conversation unless someone brings up trains or another favourite topic. In group situations, he often seems lost and doesn\u2019t join in. If other kids are playing a game, he won\u2019t take part unless it\u2019s something structured that he understands. He\u2019s very literal, so if another child is joking, he might not realise and take it seriously. He also struggles with back-and-forth conversation\u2014he either talks a lot about his interests or doesn\u2019t say much at all. \n\nClinician: Overall, how would you describe his repetitive behaviours and interests? \n\nMum: They\u2019re a big part of his life. His interests are intense, often becoming all-consuming, and he spends a huge amount of time engaging with them. When he\u2019s interested in something, it\u2019s not just a hobby\u2014it\u2019s a deep fixation that dominates his thoughts and conversations. He can talk about his favorite topics for hours without losing enthusiasm, sometimes repeating the same facts or stories multiple times. If he\u2019s watching a video or reading about something he loves, it\u2019s very difficult to pull him away from it. If he\u2019s interrupted while engaging with his interest, he often becomes frustrated or upset, struggling to shift his attention to something else. \n\nHe also has strong routines and struggles when they\u2019re disrupted. He prefers to do things in a very specific order and finds comfort in predictable patterns. If something in his routine changes unexpectedly\u2014whether it\u2019s a different breakfast, a slight alteration to his schedule, or even a change in the placement of objects in his room\u2014he reacts strongly and can become anxious or agitated. \n\nHis repetitive behaviors, like hand-flapping and pacing, are very noticeable, especially when he\u2019s feeling excited, overwhelmed, or anxious. These behaviors seem to help him regulate his emotions, and he often does them unconsciously. They become more intense when he\u2019s highly stimulated, such as when he\u2019s eagerly talking about his interests or feeling particularly nervous about something. \n\nClinician: Thank you for sharing all of this. It gives us a much clearer picture of how Eddie experiences the world."
